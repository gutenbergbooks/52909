Hardy the English lion painter. The holiday number

<p><b>Farm-Life for Young People</b>, by Ik Marvel (Donald G. Mitchell), <i>Out-of-Door Papers</i> by John Burroughs, together

novels of the day, “As It was Written,” “Mrs. Peixada,” and
“The Yoke of the Thorah.” It is the first story which he
has written for young folks. <b>My Uncle Florimond</b> is
quite a new kind of magazine serial, and handsome Gregory
Brace is quite a new kind of boy to be met in a story-book,
though fortunately for the world there are some like him in
real life. Fathers and mothers will like their young folks
to make the acquaintance of this chivalric young fellow, and
also of the true girl Rosalind. The illustrations will be by
George Wharton Edwards.</div>


<p><b>A Painter of Child-Life.</b> (First Art Paper.) A beautiful art-paper for children, by the English art-writer, T.
Letherbrow, about the English painter, Warwick Brookes, who was once a little “tear-boy” in the Manchester cotton-mills,
and afterwards rose to great eminence in art. This remarkable article is to have twenty exquisite illustrations of
child-life from photographs of the artist’s paintings and drawings.</p>

<div class="hang3">A brace of sparkling Serial Stories, <b>Those Cousins of Mabel’s</b>, and <b>Double Roses</b>, will be contributed by Mrs.
John Sherwood, author of Harper’s standard etiquette manuals,
and of “Royal Girls and Royal Courts.” In these
stories she does good service to her young countrywomen by
showing them what a pleasant and comfortable thing it is to
be acquainted with the usages of refined society and to conform
to them. The loveliness and nobility of Mabel will
render her the ideal “society girl” of young readers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-ad" id="Page_2-ad">[2a]</a></span>
everybody will follow the experiences of the brilliant Phyllis
and the piquant little Wilhelmina, the two girls from Haffreysberg,
with blended amusement and sympathy. The life
Mrs. Sherwood describes exists in all large cities, the same
embarrassments entangle young strangers to social forms,
the same heartlessness, over against the same loftiness of
character, is found among people of fashion; and the counsel
given to Phyllis and Wilhelmina will be as helpful to
thousands of other girls—and certainly this social counsel
could come from no higher authority than Mrs. Sherwood.
Charming pictures will be drawn by W. L. Taylor.</div>

<p><b>Daniel Webster in New Hampshire.</b> (First Historical Article.) Reminiscences, anecdotes, and gossip about
the great statesman, given to the author, Miss Amanda B. Harris, by Webster’s early friends and neighbors in New

<div class="hang3"><b>Plucky Small: His Story</b>, is a serial by Mary Bradford Crowninshield. “I was a wharf rat,” begins Plucky.
Plucky’s friend, “The Tinker,” was another; “why ‘The
Tinker,’” says Plucky, “he don’t know, nor I don’t know.”
Plucky does a great brave deed, and on account of it he
gets a chance to enlist “in the apprentice-service of a
United States training-ship,” and so does “the Tinker,” and
away they go on a long cruise, down around the south of
Europe, into the Mediterranean, with stops at Marseilles,
Gibraltar, and Havre—a whole ship-full of prankish boys;
and how realistic the story is may be guessed from the fact
that the author is the wife of Commander Crowninshield,
now of the U. S. School-Ship <i>St. Mary’s</i>, and has cruised
with the boys on other U. S. training-ships. Pictures by
Frank T. Merrill.</div>

years, the American artist, Henry Bacon. The picture of her in studio dress painting the famous “Head of a Lion” was
drawn by Mr. Bacon; the portrait of her at eighteen is from a painting by her brother, Auguste Bonheur. Full of
anecdote and with many pictures.</p>

<div class="hang3"><b>Children of the White House</b>, by Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton, is a series of articles of national importance and national
interest. It is a wonder that this work has not been
undertaken before for the pleasure and information of young
Americans. Starting with the little Custises, the adopted
children of Washington, this fascinating series, giving a
chapter to each Presidential family, comes down to the
present administration, gathering up delightful details of
family life, and tracing the after histories of the Presidential
children. Mrs. Upton for many years has had rare privileges
of ransacking old annals in Washington, and interesting
family reminiscences have been kindly recalled for her,
and precious relics, portraits, and paintings furnished for
photographing.</div>

<p><b>The Story of Boston Common</b>, by Edward Everett Hale, is now complete in <i>MS.</i>, and the long-expected series,

President Lincoln. Miss Seward is a born story-teller, and

<p>An historic tale connected with a holiday

<p>There is the snapdragon Christmas quarrel
of James I. of England with his sons
about the release of Sir Walter Raleigh; a
New Year’s meeting of Margery More with
Henry VIII; how William Penn got his
motto “Be true, be leal, be constant,” on
St. Valentine’s Day; how the Earl of Kildare
kept St. Patrick’s; the wise men of

<p>What is very widely known, but to many obscurely

a tramp. But trust Pansy for making

for self-improvement the most impossible people

<div class="blockquot2">

<p><span class="smcap">Whosoever, therefore, shall confess me before

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;SHALL have to begin the story for you, or
you would never understand. It happened
that the twelve girls in Mr. Shepard’s Bible
class were very nearly of an age; were class-mates
in day school, as well as on Sundays, and
were very fond of one another.</p>

<p>They lived in different parts of the country,
but were gathered in Clayville at boarding-school.</p>

<p>It came to pass that on this year of which I
write, they were to be widely scattered; only
one was to return to the school in the fall. It
was because of this fact that the thought grew
up, out of which grows my story. On the last
Sabbath before they separated, Mr. Shepard
gave to each a tiny book of texts; one for each
week, with the hint that he would like them to
live by those words in the coming year.</p>

<p>This set them to thinking and to talking.
After many plans, it was finally agreed that
they should each select a month in which to
write a letter that should give some account of
an experience connected with one of the verses
for that month. These letters were to be passed
by mail from one member of the class to another
until each had read them; and I, being a particular
friend of several of the girls, have the
privilege of reading them, and of making a copy
for you, my Blossoms.</p>

<p>Cora Stevens had the month of November, and,
without more introduction, I give you her letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Maplewood</span>, <i>Nov. 18</i>—<br />
</div>

<div class="unindent"><span class="smcap">You dear Girls</span>:</div>

<p>I hope you every one miss me as much as I
do you! Really and truly, I am dreadfully
homesick for school! But this is my special
letter, so I must not take time for anything else.
I’m sorry I promised to write the first one, because
I don’t know just how to write it, and I
have such a mean, silly little story to tell, that
I’m ashamed of it, anyhow.</p>

<p>I chose that verse about “confessing before
men,” for the one to write my letter on. And
I meant to go to the young people’s meeting,
and to the Band, and confess Him in some way
that would be nice to tell; and I didn’t do anything
of the kind.</p>

<p>Don’t you think my story is about a cat!
Who would have supposed that a cat would get
mixed up with a verse like that?</p>

<p>We went to grandma’s, as usual, for the month
of November, but things there were very unusual,
for aunt Kate was married, and the house
was full of company and confusion.</p>

<p>It is about the wedding day that I’m to tell
you. I wish you could have seen the tables
after they were ready. They did look too lovely
for anything! The central table was magnificent.
All the old silver and queer, quaint china
which have been in grandma’s family for ages,
had been brought out for decoration, and people
say that the tablecloth was the finest piece of
old damask that has ever been used in this part
of the world. If I had Nettie’s descriptive
powers, I could give you a picture of the whole;
but as it is, I want you to confine your attention
to one dish—the loveliest cut-glass beauty that
was ever seen. It was amber-colored sometimes,
with little threads of crimson running through
it, which reminded one of a sunset. Besides, it
was a very peculiarly-shaped dish, and as frail
as a cobweb. Uncle Fred found it in Paris, and
brought it to the bride. Uncle Fred, you understand,
is the bridegroom.</p>

<p>Well, it was on the special wedding table,
just before the bride’s seat, and was filled with
the most exquisite flowers.</p>

<p>Grandma did not want the dish used, because
it was so frail and so rare, but aunt Kate insisted
that it should be placed just there, and
be filled with orange-buds.</p>

<p>Grandma had just seen that the very last
touches had been put to the table, and had taken
the children in for a look, and then had said, as
she shut the dining-room door: “Now, don’t
one of you children open that door again. I
wouldn’t have anything go wrong in there for a
great deal.”</p>

<p>Then she went up to take a last look at aunt
Kate, before she became Mrs. Fred Somerville.</p>

<p>Just at that moment little Sallie Evans came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
running down the hall, her eyes full of tears.
Her mamma had called her just as grandma took
the children in to see the tables, and she had
missed the sight.</p>

<p>“And now I sha’n’t see them at all, till
everything is spoiled,” she said, “for they aren’t
going to let the little bits of cousins come to the
first table.” And she sobbed outright.</p>

<p>Now it never entered my mind that grandma
meant me, when she said, “You children,” because—well,
because, you know, I am thirteen,
and there are three at home, younger than I,
and I’m used to being trusted. So I said,
“Never mind, Sallie, I’ll let you look at them;
but you must look fast, for it is almost time for
the wedding.”</p>

<p>So, in we went. And Sallie, who is the most
beauty-loving little creature of eight, whom I
ever saw, seemed to have eyes only for that
lovely glass dish, which she had never seen before.
She clasped her hands together with an
eager little “Oh!” and ran towards it. I don’t
suppose she would have touched it, but I was
excited, and so afraid she would, that I ran after
her, calling out, “Don’t touch anything!” and
put out my hand to prevent it. And then, I
don’t know how it happened—does anybody
know how such accidents happen? The lace
from my sleeve caught in one of the points of
the glass, or in one of the stems of flowers, or
somehow,—I don’t suppose I could do it again
if I tried,—but over that glass went, the water
pouring itself out in the most disgusting way,
on the damask cloth, and a long crooked piece
snapped from the upper edge of the dish!</p>

<p>O, dear! Don’t ask me how I felt. I
couldn’t describe it, even though I were sitting
on the dear old bed at No. 7, with half a dozen
of you beside me, and the rest cuddled around
close at hand.</p>

<p>There wasn’t any time to do anything. I
heard them calling, at that moment, for I was
one of the bridesmaids. I just had to force
back my tears and my fright, and run and take
my place in the procession. We all got through
it somehow. I hope aunt Kate heard what the
minister said; I didn’t; but it is safe to say that
she was not thinking of what I was.</p>

<p>Immediately after the ceremony, we went to
the dining-room, and then the awful accident
was discovered. I don’t know which I was the
most sorry for, grandma or myself. I didn’t
mean to tell about it then, because I thought
it wouldn’t be the proper time; and then, of
course, it would be dreadful to have to speak
before them at all.</p>

<p>But what should grandma do, after we were
all seated, and the eating had begun, but lean
over to aunt Kate and say in a low tone: “That
is some of Jill’s work; if I don’t get rid of a cat
who can open doors, before I am a day older, it
will be because I am not smart enough.”</p>

<p>Now, Jill is the cutest cat that was ever born,
I do believe; there isn’t a door in grandma’s
house that she cannot manage to open almost
as well as though she had hands.</p>

<p>I never thought of her blaming the cat; and
now the story came out, just as they guessed it
had happened, and all the people at our end of
the table talked it over.</p>

<p>Even then, I don’t know whether I would
have spoken, because Jill is only a cat, you know,
and her feelings couldn’t be hurt by bearing
blame that didn’t belong to her for a few hours,
until I could see grandma alone. But, just as I
was thinking that, I heard grandma say: “The
fault rests with little John. I charged him a
dozen times to keep watch of that cat, and not
on any account let her out of the barn to-day;
and that is all the good it did! I think I have
given John a lesson on obedience that he will
remember.”</p>

<p>Now John is the little errand boy; a real nice
chubby little fellow, who was very fond of aunt
Kate, and who had never tasted wedding cake,
and he was to drive one of the carriages to the
depot that very day, to see the bridal party off.</p>

<p>It all came over me like a flash—how grandma
would forbid his coming in to the wedding supper,
and how she would not let him drive to the
depot, but would send him to bed; and I felt
just as though I should choke!</p>

<p>Even then, it didn’t seem to me that I could
speak out then and there; and I don’t believe
I could have done it, but for the verse.</p>

<p>Girls, I know you don’t see how the verse is
coming in, and I can’t explain myself how it
seemed to fit; there was certainly nothing about
“confessing” Jesus in my telling of what I had
done. And yet, you see, I knew I ought to tell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and I know it is what Jesus would do in my
place, and it would be showing that I wanted to
copy him, and—well, anyhow, it seemed to
fit exactly, though I can’t explain it. And I
spoke right out, loud and fast: “Grandmother,
it wasn’t the cat; John didn’t let the cat out; it
was I did it.”</p>

<p>My voice sounded so loud that it almost
seemed as though they could hear me down at
the church; the people at our table all stopped
talking, and I just knew they could hear my
heart beat.</p>

<p>“You!” said grandma. “You let the cat
out?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” I said, “I broke the dish.”</p>

<p>Then she questioned, and I answered, until
somehow, she had the whole story.</p>

<p>I don’t think any tears dropped, but my eyes
and my throat felt full of them. It didn’t
seem to me that I could say another word, and
then grandma said: “Well, well, child, there
are worse things in the world than broken dishes.
Eat your wedding cake, and think no more
about it.” And I heard her call one of the
waiters, and say to him: “Tell little John that
he may dress himself again in his best suit, and
come to the dining-room as soon as he is ready.”
Then I knew that I had been none too soon
with my confession.</p>

<p>And the bride, my dear, sweet aunt Kate,
leaned over toward me and spoke low, “There
are better things than glass dishes,” she said;
“there are little nieces who are true.”</p>

<p>And papa looked across the table at me, and
nodded, and smiled.</p>

<p>And in spite of the lovely broken dish, and
the tablecloth, and my being ashamed, and all,
I never felt happier in my life.</p>

<p>And as for the verse, if you girls can’t fit it
to the cat story, I shall not be surprised; for I
can’t explain it myself, but I know they fitted
when the time came. Good-by!</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THERE are four of us young people at
home: first I, who am sixteen, then there
is a long gap, and next comes Katie,
who is eight, and Bessie, who is six,
and last of all baby Harry, who is not
yet two. But we were all a year younger when
what I mean to tell you of happened, for that
was a year ago.</p>

<p>I spoke of Katie and Bessie and Harry and
myself as the young people, because I think I
am rather too old to be called a child, and I
didn’t know how else to put it, but I don’t at all
mean to call father and mother old. It is true
father has a great many gray streaks in his hair,
but I think that is more from care than from
age.</p>

<p>It makes me sad, however, very sad, to see
father’s hair changing color; but when I speak
of it, he only laughs and says: “The whites are
gaining the ascendency, and the aborigines becoming
extinct.”</p>

<p>Father and mother have not looked like themselves
since the summer mother was so ill. That
was the most dreadful period of my life, I am
sure. For a long time we thought she couldn’t
recover. She was ill, of course, to begin with,
and then the expense of having a doctor and
nurse preyed on her mind and made against her.
I really believe mother minded that more than
the pain she suffered! At one time she got so
nervous with thinking of it, that she said Dr.
May’s visits did her more harm than good, and
declared she wouldn’t see him again; but Dr.
Armstrong, our minister, happened to come in
just then, and he soon reasoned her out of all
that and made her see things differently.</p>

<p>There couldn’t possibly be a nicer minister
than Dr. Armstrong,—I can’t begin to say how
much I love him; better, indeed, than anybody
in the world, outside of home, except a dear
friend, Miss Judith Hepburn. Miss Judith lives
next door to us; she is old and very poor;
she has, in fact, nothing in the world but the
house she lives in, and so she occupies only one
of the rooms on the first floor, and lives on the
rent from the others. But Miss Judith is as
happy as if she possessed all this world has to
offer, and happier, too, for that matter, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
is because she is such a true Christian. “Whatever
befalls us is good,” she says, “whether it
comes in the shape of prosperity or of adversity,
because everything is bestowed by a loving
Hand.”</p>

<div class="caption">AMUSING BABY HARRY.</div>
</div>

<p>I forgot to say, all this while, that my name
is Annie—Annie Gray—but Miss Judith never
calls me anything but “Martha.” She commenced
this when mother was ill, because I
kept so busy, and perhaps, too, because I was
“troubled about many things,” for indeed I was
all during her illness, and for a long time after,
too, for the debt we owed to the doctor and
nurse hung like a black cloud over the household.
It is different with some people, but debt
has always seemed a very serious evil to us. I
believe father has dreaded it almost more than
anything else, and up to mother’s illness, he had
always avoided it; but the demands which sickness
makes are very great, and can’t be easily
disregarded.</p>

<p>Ah! how often I have heard father say:
“Owe no man anything,” after which he would
always add, “whether this is a Divine command,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
or only loving counsel I cannot say, but, in
either case, I shall not willingly disregard it.”</p>

<p>Well, it was right funny, but soon after
mother’s illness, Dr. Armstrong commenced his
Friday evening lectures to the congregation
“On Secular Matters,” as he said in his notice.
Father took me to the first one, and I couldn’t
help giving his hand a squeeze when he gave out
the subject, “Debts: How They are Made, and
How They May be Paid.” I can’t remember
the words he used, which is a pity, but Dr. Armstrong’s
words, as well as his thoughts, are
forcible, but I know the sense of it all was that
debts are generally commenced in a small way,
little by little, little by little, they are added one
to the other, till presently an account is presented
to us of such overwhelming proportions that we
despair of ever wiping it out. “But I trust,”
he added, “that none of my friends who find
themselves in this unhappy situation will give
way for a moment to a feeling of discouragement.
Step by step have we been led into
trouble; let us retrace our way in like manner,
step by step. Begin from this moment a system
of judicious retrenchment; lay aside sums, never
mind how trifling, toward the liquidation of
your debt, and little by little it will melt away,
till, almost unconsciously to yourself, it has disappeared,
and you, again a free man, ‘can look
the whole world in the face.’”</p>

<p>“Ah, that was practical! That was what I
needed!” said father, as we came out after the
lecture was over, “and I, for one, shall not
‘approve the doctrine and immediately practice
the contrary.’ No; from this very moment I
shall begin to retrench and put by. Ah, Annie,
‘a word in season,’ how good it is! I was
almost ready to despair till now.”</p>

<p>And that was the beginning of our saving.
First, coffee was given up; mother always drank
tea, and so no one was inconvenienced by that but
father; then butter was dispensed with, and the
cheapest meat and vegetables in the market
were selected, and mother decided that so many
things were unnecessary about our clothes, that
Katie declared after a while mother would think
we could do without buttons on our dresses.
But my happy part of the day, during all this
anxious time, was the twilight when there was
no work for me to do and I could run in and sit
by Miss Judith’s bright little fire and talk over
things with her. It was on one of these evenings,
after Miss Judith’s usual greeting of, “Well,
Martha, how has the work come on to-day?”
that I said, “Indeed, Miss Judith, I wish I were
not such a ‘Martha,’ and that I might ‘choose
the better part,’ like Mary. But then, what can
I do? Wouldn’t it be wrong for me to throw
things on mother when she isn’t strong, and
don’t you think our Saviour would think so,
too? Then, besides, mother would have to be
a ‘Martha,’ for the work must be done. I am
sure it is all very puzzling to me, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I do not wonder that you say so, dear,” said
Miss Judith, “for older heads than yours have
puzzled over the same question, and certain it is
that were it not for the ‘Marthas’ in the world
the whole system of society would come to a
stand-still. But, then, Annie, we are told that
Martha was ‘<i>cumbered</i> with serving’; she allowed
her work, it would seem, to absorb her
faculties to the exclusion of other and more
important things; we need not do that, need
we? Has not each one of us, even the busiest
among us, leisure sufficient to consecrate his
work to God in prayer, and ask His blessing
upon it, and His help in it? Then, my child,”
she continued, “observe the words of our
Saviour, ‘Mary has chosen the better part’;
that is better than Martha, but perhaps there
is a ‘better part,’ still, or the best part, in
which labor and worship are united, in which,
while ‘not slothful in business,’ we are still
‘fervent in spirit serving the Lord.’ This would
seem to me the best part, and surely the best
example is that of the blessed Saviour Himself,
who ‘came not to be ministered to, but to
minister,’ who ‘went about doing good,’ and
‘followed up days of toil with nights of prayer.’
Yes, my dear, the necessity of serving is evidently
laid upon you, and you have not the
choice of your part in life, but the manner in
which you act your part is within your power.
Don’t forget, dear child, that you ‘serve the
Lord Christ,’ and ‘whatsoever you do, do it
heartily as unto Him.’ He has taken a journey
into a far country now, but he will come again
to inspect your work; be faithful, dear Annie,
and watch and pray.”</p>

<p>That little talk with Miss Judith did me real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
good. My little talks with her always do, and
mother says that she is the greatest possible
comfort to her, for she shows her how useful
one may be, even where one has only sympathy
and counsel to bestow; and father says that
there is a healing and strengthening power in
her words, which is far better than a gift of
silver and gold, for it enables you to “rise up
and walk” under the burden of life.</p>

<p>The children certainly did bear the privations
we underwent well, but Katie said to me privately
one night, “I never did want something
good to eat as badly in my life. I am real glad
Thanksgiving Day is so near.” But when the
day before Thanksgiving came, and mother asked
if I should get anything different for dinner
next day, father shook his head with such a
decided “no” that there was nothing more to be
said, but it was undoubtedly a change; we had
never known what it was not to have turkey
and pudding then. I was most grieved, however,
at the thought of not having my usual
present for Miss Judith. I had always, on
that day, carried her in her dinner, and on the
waiter a five dollar bill; but as I went up stairs
at night, father slipped five dollars into my
hand, saying, “This is for Miss Judith, Annie.
We must not forget, in our efforts to retrench,
the debt we owe our Heavenly Father.”</p>

<p>That was enough to put me in a proper frame
for the next day, even if I had not already had
sufficient to be thankful for. I had quite made
up my mind that mother was to go to church,
and let me mind Harry, but there was a great
deal of persuading necessary to get her up to
the point. However, I succeeded at last, and
after they were all gone and I had washed up the
breakfast things, Master Harry began to show
symptoms of sleepiness, so I tucked him in his
little cradle, and began rocking him to and fro,
singing all the while one of Miss Judith’s favorite
hymns:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“One by one thy duties wait thee,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With thy whole strength go to each,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Let no future dreams elate thee,</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Every day begin again.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Over and over I sang it, till at last the white
lids closed, and I was getting up softly to slip
away, when ting-a-ling! went the door-bell, with
such a sound through the house that Harry
stirred, then opened his blue eyes to their fullest
extent, and I was obliged to get him quiet
again before answering the bell. When at last
I did go down, lo! not a creature was to be
seen: only a hamper-basket covered with a white
cloth with a paper pinned on top, on which was
written: “For Mr. Gray; from a friend.”</p>

<p>It was just as much as I could do to get the
basket into the kitchen, and then, oh! the good
things that met my eyes. First of all, a turkey
ready dressed, then a roll of golden butter, then
several jars of sausage-meat and jelly, then a
bunch of celery, and last a great iced cake.
This completed the contents, but no; as I lifted
out the lower cloth there lay a sealed envelope
directed, as the basket had been, to father.
This I laid aside till his return, but what to do
about the other things was puzzling. They are
clearly intended for father’s Thanksgiving dinner,
I thought, but unless the turkey is put to roast
right away it won’t be done in time. Shall I,
or shall I not? I said to myself. Then I remembered
how feeble dear mother looked when
she set out; how she feared the services would
be too much for her strength. Yes, I said decidedly,
by way of answering my doubts, a
warm nourishing dinner will be just what she
needs, and so, without more ado, I set to work.
The baby (bless his little heart!) was real good,
and let me, get well “under way” before he
waked up. There was no keeping the secret of
the dinner, however, when the front door was
once entered, for the savory odor of the roasting
turkey told the tale at once, and the whole party
hurried into the kitchen to find out what it
meant.</p>

<p>“O, father!” I said, when the exclamations
over the first part of my recital had sufficiently
subsided to admit of my getting in a word,
“there was a letter for you in the basket, too.”</p>

<p>“This will give us the name of the donor,”
said he, as he opened it. But, no indeed, there
was no name inside, only some notes neatly
folded. “Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five
dollars,” said father, counting them out on the
table. “God be praised for all His mercies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and God bless the giver!” said he, fervently,
while mother turned away to get Miss Judith’s
dinner ready, and hide her tears, for poor
mother was actually crying.</p>

<p>“Take this, too, Annie,” said father, putting
another five on the one already lying on the
waiter, when at last it was ready for me to take
in. Of course I had to stop and tell Miss Judith
the wonderful news about the basket, and when
I got back again mother was putting the last
dish on the table; then, going to our places, we
stood with bowed heads while father said the
grace I had always been accustomed to hear, but
which seemed to have gained new meaning and
beauty,—</p>

<p>“Supply the wants of others, O Lord, and
give us grateful hearts, for Christ’s sake.”</p>

<p>We never knew the secret of that Thanksgiving
basket, nor did we ever inquire into it,
but we all had a notion that Dr. Armstrong
could have thrown light upon the subject if he
had chosen to.</p>

<h2>A SEVENFOLD TROUBLE.</h2>

<div class="center">(<i>Told by Seven People who Knew of it.</i>)<br />

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-m.jpg" width="81" height="138" alt="M" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">MARGARET threw an old shawl over
her head and went out the side door.
This had been a hard day. Weston
had been very cross, and insisted upon
having her run a great many errands
for him, some of them unnecessary.</p>

<p>This, too, was the first day of the fall term
of school, and Margaret had so wanted to be
early at school to secure her old seat; for she had
heard that Helen Marcy was going to try to get
it first. She had almost forgotten her new resolves
in the morning when her step-mother had
told her she would have to stay home to-day
and help her.</p>

<p>As the tears came into Margaret’s eyes, Mrs.
Moore had remarked: “Now’s a good time to
show your religion. A girl that’s joined the
church shouldn’t go around pouting all day because
she’s asked to do a little work; especially
when she’s been off doing nothing at the seashore.”</p>

<p>It was all true, Margaret knew it, but it
seemed so hateful of her to say it. It had been
so hard to bear.</p>

<p>After tea she walked down to the gate and
stood staring out into the darkness.</p>

<p>It was a very hard life, all just as black and
unlovely as that dark autumn evening.</p>

<p>She glanced back at the house. There was
Johnnie bending over his books, the gaslight
above him brought him out in clear relief against
the dark room. Naughty Johnnie! How he
had teased her every time he came near her that
day! Nobody cared for her much. She gazed
down the street. Here and there a light gleamed
out. Across the way there was a bright fire in
the fireplace, and the family seemed to be having
a happy time, sitting around the table, sewing,
reading, laughing and talking. The little girl
was sitting in her father’s lap. How Margaret
longed for such a pleasant evening in their
home. She turned involuntarily back to the
house. Her father and Mr. Wakefield, the minister,
had gone out just after tea, and Mrs.
Moore had gone to her own room directly after
the dishes were washed. The house was all
dark, save Johnnie’s one gas jet. It was just
unbearable. No other girl in the world had
such a hard lot. It couldn’t possibly be any
worse.</p>

<p>Yes, she really thought so, this poor silly little
girl.</p>

<p>But she did not altogether forget her Heavenly
Father. She remembered presently, with a glad
thrill of joy, that she belonged to the rich King
of all the earth. He could help her. She would
ask Him.</p>

<p>Down went her head on the gate-post, and
she told her Father in Heaven all about it, and
how she could not possibly stand it.</p>

<p>Then she raised her head with a confident
feeling that now all would be well, and fell to
planning different ways in which her prayer
might be answered.</p>

<p>She didn’t exactly want her step-mother to
die! She was rather shocked at the thought.
That was a very wrong thought for a Christian
girl to have.</p>

<p>Poor little Margaret! She thought she loved
Jesus, and was trying with all her might to
serve him, but she still had to learn the command:
“Honor thy father and thy mother.”</p>

<p>Throwing that disagreeable thought aside, she
went on. How <i>could</i> it all be changed? Perhaps
some rich, unheard-of relative of her
mother’s would die and leave a vast fortune to
her as her mother’s only daughter. Then what
would she do? She would give her father
enough so that he wouldn’t have to work anymore.
She would—yes, she would show a
very Christian spirit toward Mrs. Moore. She
would re-furnish the house, and hire several servants
for her, and give her enough to buy beautiful
dresses. The boys should be sent to college,
and she,—she would go off to boarding-school
and study as much as she liked, and never have
to stay home and wash dishes. She would have
plenty of money to give away. She would buy
a great many flowers to give to poor sick people.
Her room should be beautifully furnished, and
she would invite all the poor girls in school there
and give them nice times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>She was just treating those imaginary girls to
chocolate creams and marshmallow drops, when
she heard her father’s step coming swiftly down
the street, and his voice say: “Margaret, you
should not be out in this chilly night air.” Then
she turned and followed him into the house.
She had to give up her musings for a while and
help Johnnie with his arithmetic lesson, but she
promised herself more castle-building when she
went to her own room, before she slept.</p>

<p>But presently her father called her. “Margaret,”
he said, “I have a letter here from your
Aunt Cornelia. She wishes you to come and
spend the winter with her and attend school.
Would you like to go?”</p>

<p>Margaret’s heart bounded with joy. Not
alone with the pleasure of going to Aunt Cornelia,
but with a sort of triumphant feeling that
her prayer was answered, and that so soon. She
resolved complacently that she should always
pray for everything. Poor child! She thought
her faith was very great.</p>

<p>It was quite dark in the room and Margaret
could not see her father’s face as he said this,
but his voice was very kind. The door into
the hall was partly open, and the streak of light
which came from it fell upon the sofa, and
showed the dim outlines of Mrs. Moore lying
there with her head bound up in a handkerchief.
There was a faint odor of camphor and vinegar
pervading the room and Margaret’s conscience
smote her as she remembered her hard thoughts
out by the gate. Perhaps Mrs. Moore had been
suffering all day from a sick headache, and that
was why she was so severe. The little girl’s
heart softened and she resolved to pray that the
headache be cured, which, however, she forgot
to do. You must remember how full her heart
was of excitement, and pity this poor young
Christian.</p>

<p>It was all settled that evening that she should
go in a week, and she went up to her room to
write a letter overflowing with thanks to dear
Aunt Cornelia, and then went to bed to dream
of the new life.</p>

<p>How easy it would be to be a Christian, living
with Aunt Cornelia, she thought, while she was
dressing the next morning. God must have
seen how utterly impossible it was for her to
serve him truly here in her home, and so planned
this for her. But her thoughts were interrupted
by a knock at her door, and Johnnie
called out:</p>

<p>“Say, Mag, <i>she’s</i> sick, an’ father’s gone for
the doctor, an’ he said you must come an’ get
some breakfast, an’ West’s cross, an’ it rains like
sixty, an’ the wood’s all wet, an’ I can’t make
the fire burn. Can’t you come quick?”</p>

<p>Had Margaret known all the trials that were
to come to her that day, she would have stopped,
in that little minute that stood between her
bright hopes of the night before, and the unknown
future, to ask her Heavenly Father for
strength for what was to come. But she did
not. Perhaps it was some shadow of coming
trouble that made her reach out her hand and
push the letter she had written into her upper
bureau drawer. Then she hastened down-stairs.
Desolation reigned there. Johnnie’s books and
slate were scattered over the dining-room table,
just as he had left them the night before. Weston
had added to the confusion by spending his
evening in cutting bits out of several newspapers
for his scrap-book, and little white snips were
scattered thick over the floor. Margaret remembered
that the dining-room always before
looked nice when she came down in the morning.
It <i>did</i> make a difference to have a mother
around, even if she <i>was</i> only a step-mother.</p>

<p>Out in the kitchen Johnnie was rattling the
stove and the smoke was pouring out of every
crevice.</p>

<p>It was late that morning before the new minister
got his breakfast, and the steak was smoky
and the coffee muddy-looking, but he smiled
pleasantly at Margaret’s red face and told her
that she had done well for the first time.</p>

<p>While they were at breakfast, Mr. Moore came
in with the doctor.</p>

<p>They went directly up-stairs, but soon came
down again, the doctor taking out his medicine-case
and calling for glasses and water. Mr.
Moore looked anxious and worried. Margaret
tried to hear the doctor’s replies to her father’s
troubled questions, but she only caught words
now and then:</p>

<p>“Inflammatory rheumatism.” “System completely
run down.” “Rest for several months.”</p>

<p>These were the bits of phrases that came to
Margaret through the open kitchen door, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
stood by the faucet drawing water for the doctor.
The rest of the sentences were drowned
by the rush of the water, but Margaret could
easily imagine it, and her heart stood still.</p>

<p>She knew that this meant many things that
the doctor did not say.</p>

<p>It meant that she could not go to Aunt Cornelia’s;
that she must spend the winter at home;
that she must be the one who must constantly
wait on the sick woman. She could even now
hear the irritable words which she imagined her
step-mother would use to her when she didn’t do
everything just right.</p>

<p>Then a great rebellion arose in her heart.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/illus040.jpg" width="389" height="557" alt="Margaret" />
<div class="caption">SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN HER RESOLVES.</div>
</div>

<p>“God hasn’t answered my prayer at all,” she
said to herself, and the great disappointment
made her hand shake as she set the water-pitcher
down before the doctor.</p>

<p>Mr. Moore didn’t think his little girl had
heard the doctor’s words, and he looked after
her with a troubled sigh as she went back to
the kitchen. How should he tell her? Would
she storm and cry as she had been wont to do
when her will was crossed? He decided that
he would not tell her that day.</p>

<p>The breakfast dishes washed, Johnnie at school,
and her father up-stairs, Margaret betook herself
to the kitchen to wail out her sorrow and pity
herself. She dared not go to her own room,
lest she should be heard. Rebellion was in her
soul, and the more she cried the more she pitied
herself and cried again. Mr. Wakefield, coming
to the kitchen to ask for some warm water,
found Margaret with her arms on the table, and
her head on her arms, sobbing great angry, disappointed
sobs. He stopped in dismay.</p>

<p>“Why, Margaret, what is the matter? Is
there anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“No, there isn’t! God hasn’t answered my
prayer! You said he would! Now I’ve got
to stay at home and wait on <i>her!</i> I don’t believe
he heard me at all!”</p>

<p>Margaret fairly screamed this out. She had
worked herself into such a state that she scarcely
knew what she was saying. Was this the gentle,
humble Christian he had received into the church
but two days before? This thought passed
through the minister’s mind, but he was too wise
to express it to the excited little girl. He only
asked quietly:</p>

<p>“Margaret, does your father always say ‘yes’
to you when you ask for something?”</p>

<p>“Why, no; of course not!” she said, in surprise.</p>

<p>“And suppose you should ask for something,
and he should say No, would you come and tell
me that your father would not answer you?”</p>

<p>She did not answer this time, and Mr. Wakefield
went on:</p>

<p>“Suppose your father knows that what you
ask would be very hurtful to you, would you
think him cruel to refuse you?”</p>

<p>“But this isn’t hurtful! It’s best for me!
God wants me to be a Christian, and I never
can be one in this house!” she burst out.</p>

<p>“Margaret, which do you think knows best,
you who know so little, or God who made you,
and who sees all things that ever have happened
or ever will happen in your life? My little
friend, I am afraid you didn’t pray in the right
spirit,”—</p>

<p>“O, yes, I did!” she interrupted eagerly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
“I believed. I thought of course He would
give it to me.”</p>

<p>“But believing is not the only thing. You
forgot to put one little sentence in, ‘Thy will
be done.’ If you had put it in words your
prayer would sound something like this: ‘Our
Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy
name, Thy kingdom come, Margaret Moore’s
will be done,’”—</p>

<p>At this Margaret couldn’t help smiling through
her tears.</p>

<p>“Your kind Heavenly Father didn’t give you
just what you asked for, because he saw that it
would not be best for you. Perhaps he saw
that his servant must learn patiently to serve
him at home, among trials, before she would ever
make the right kind of servant out in the world.
He will answer your prayer in some other way
than the one you had planned, Margaret. He
loves you a great deal better than you love
yourself. Can’t you trust him?”</p>

<p>And then the minister went away without his
hot water. Went back to his room to pray for
the poor little troubled disciple down-stairs.
And Margaret sat and thought. She saw now
just how foolish and wicked she had been. She
had a long struggle with her rebellious heart,
kneeling on the bare floor with her head on the
kitchen table, but she conquered at last, and the
peace of God filled her heart. She was resolved
now to give up her own way and try to do God’s
way. “But, dear Jesus,” she prayed, “I’ll have
to be helped a great deal, for I can’t do it alone,
and I know I shall cry if they say much about
Aunt Cornelia.”</p>

<p>Margaret had found the right way to do all
she could herself and trust in Jesus for the rest,
and to give up her life, her will, her whole self
into his keeping.</p>

<p>But she remembered that she had other duties
and that her father might be down-stairs at any
moment, so she hastened to her room to wash
away the traces of tears.</p>

<p>Half-way down the stairs she paused. “Would
not it please Jesus if she were to knock at
mother’s door and ask if there was anything she
could do?”</p>

<p>She retraced her steps softly and gave a very
gentle knock. Her father came from the darkened
room, his face so careworn that it almost
startled her. “Father, please don’t look so
worried. Everything will be all right. I can
keep house,” she said.</p>

<p>Her father regarded her with a tender, sorrowful
look.</p>

<p>“Does my little girl know that she cannot go
away this winter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I know it. Never mind that. It’s
all right, father.”</p>

<p>Mr. Moore was so amazed and pleased at this
new character exhibited by his daughter that he
scarcely knew what to say.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry it is so, Margaret, but your
mother is very sick. She has been under a great
strain this summer. You will have to wait on
her and be a general help. I would hire some
one else to do it if I could afford it, but I cannot.
Your mother’s sister, Amelia, who has
been living in Brierly with her brother, will
come, I think, and keep house, and then the
minister need not go away, for we need all the
money we can get now to pay the doctor’s bills.”</p>

<div class="caption">THERE SAT JOHNNIE.</div>
</div>
<p>Margaret’s face fell.</p>

<p>“Must we have her? Isn’t there some one
else we can have?” she said, lowering her voice.</p>

<p>“Not without paying for it,” said her father,
sadly.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I do the work?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No, Margaret; you will have all you can do
to wait on your mother, and,” he added, “I
am afraid you cannot even go to school here at
home,—for a time, at least. I am sorry, but I
don’t see any other way out just now.”</p>

<p>Margaret felt very much like bursting into
tears again, but a glance at her father’s worn
face changed her feelings.</p>

<p>“Never mind, father, I’ll do all I can, and be
as good as I can.” And she wound her arms
around her father’s neck and kissed him.</p>

<p>If she only could have known how much that
kiss comforted her father. He went back into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the darkened room with a lightened heart and
a feeling that there must be something in religion,
for it had changed Margaret wonderfully.</p>

<p>Margaret snatched the first hour that came to
her to write a letter to Aunt Cornelia, telling her
how impossible it was for her to come to her,
and how very sorry she was, and soon there
came a long, sympathetic, helpful answer, and
with it a little book bound in green and silver.
“To help you when you feel discouraged,” the
good auntie wrote.</p>

<p>On the first page Margaret opened, her eyes
met these words:</p>

<h2>THE FIRST LOAD.</h2>

<p class='dropcapstory'>IT was a warm, sunny Sunday morning,
and consequently Robbie Ellsworth was
allowed to go to church. This was
quite a luxury to him, because he had
but recently recovered from the measles, and his
mother was rather afraid to have him go.</p>

<p>The notices were all given out, at least so the
people thought, when the minister announced
that there would be a meeting of the congregation
the next day, to raise money for a new
church. That building, they saw, was altogether
too small, and he did hope they would get a
new one started very soon, as a lot was donated
in a fine location.</p>

<p>Then came the sermon. It was about little
things. Robbie listened attentively, as the minister
told how many great things had been
started and helped by little boys and girls, and
by people with little money or talent.</p>

<p>At the dinner table Robbie’s father remarked,
“How anxious Dr. Sullivan is for a new church!
But he won’t get it—not very soon, anyway.
The people don’t care enough about it, though
I’m sure they need one badly.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” thought Robbie to himself, “I
do wish Dr. Sullivan could get the new church.
I’m sure he ought to have it if he wants it.”</p>

<p>“He wants a brick one,” Mr. Ellsworth continued,
“but in my opinion a frame building
would do this time. Brick costs too much.”</p>

<p>“I wish he could have a brick church,”
thought Robbie. “It would be so much nicer.”</p>

<p>Then he went to thinking about what Dr.
Sullivan said in his sermon, and pretty soon he
began to wonder if he couldn’t help with the
new church. All the afternoon he thought
about it, and finally a plan came into his little
mind, which he thought of so much that he
could hardly sleep that night. But he didn’t
want anybody to know anything about it, so he
went to sleep as fast as he could.</p>

<p>Fortunately for his plans, Monday was as
pleasant as Sunday, and about ten o’clock Robbie
went to Mrs. Ellsworth.</p>

<p>“Mamma, I want to go take a walk,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why, Robbie dear, you would get lost.”</p>

<p>“But I only want to go around to Uncle
Will’s,” pleaded the little fellow.</p>

<p>Now Uncle Will was a doctor, a great favorite
with his little nephew, and he lived only
around the corner, in the new house which he
had just built.</p>

<p>“I think you may go, then,” said Mrs. Ellsworth,
“as you don’t have to cross the street to
get there. I am going down to papa’s office,
and will tell him to stop for you when he comes
home.”</p>

<p>“No, mamma,” said Robbie, “I’d rather not.
I have a very much reason for wanting to
come home alone.”</p>

<p>That was his way of saying he had a very
good, and, in his eyes, important reason, which
he didn’t want to give. So his mother agreed,
kissed him good-by, and he started out, first getting
his little green wheelbarrow from the hall
closet.</p>

<p>He trudged along down one street, up another,
till he stopped on the stone steps of
“Uncle Will’s house,” and gave the bell such a
pull as only a boy of about Robbie’s size knows
how.</p>

<p>Aunt Flora greeted her small visitor very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
warmly, laughing at his wheelbarrow, but he
pushed right by her, and trudged into Uncle
Will’s office, pushing his wheelbarrow before
him. Uncle Will was engaged in discussing the
cholera germ with a brother physician, but he
turned and welcomed his nephew cheerily:</p>

<p>“Well, my man! What can I do for you to-day?
Will you cart a wheelbarrow of books
around to the library for me?”</p>

<p>“Mamma wouldn’t let me,” said Robbie. “I
came to see if you would let me have one wheelbarrowful
of the bricks that were left over—out
in the back yard.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Uncle Will. “You can go
right out and get them.”</p>

<p>So Robbie turned again, too eager to even
thank his uncle, pushed his wheelbarrow through
the dining-room, and was soon taking down
bricks from the pile by the back stoop.</p>

<p>His barrow didn’t hold but about a half-dozen,
and soon Irish Mary was lifting it up the
steps, and he arrived again before his uncle’s
door.</p>

<p>“Are they my very own, Uncle Will,” he
asked, as that gentleman turned to look at his
load, “to use just as I want to?”</p>

<p>“Your very own,” said the doctor, “to do
what you please with. If you wish, you may
throw them in the cistern. But what are they
for?”</p>

<p>“I would rather not tell, Uncle Will.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. Success to your project,
whatever it is.”</p>

<p>Down the steps bumped the wheelbarrow,
with its owner behind, and down the street they
went again, though this time on the other side
of the block. There were not many pedestrians
on the street, but the few Robbie met smiled at
him and his load of bricks. He looked at all
the houses attentively, and finally mounted the
steps of one with difficulty, all the time afraid
his bricks would fall out, and rang the bell a
little more gently than he had at his uncle’s.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Sullivan came to the door. He
knew Robbie. “Good-morning, young man!”
he said. “What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Robbie. “I’ve brought you
the first load of bricks for the new church.”</p>

<p>“The new church!” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. You said yesterday you wanted
one, and papa said you wanted a brick one. So
I’ve brought the first load. They’re my very
own, sir, to use just as I want to.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” said Dr. Sullivan, “I am very
much obliged to you,” and Robbie thought his
voice sounded almost as his did when he had
the croup. Moreover, he took out his handkerchief
and rubbed his eyes. Then he took
the wheelbarrow in his arms, and having deposited
the contents in his backyard, returned
it to the owner. “The bricks shall be used,
young man,” he said, “every one of them, for
the new church. Thank you very much for
your help.”</p>

<p>Then Robbie returned home, jubilant at having
been able to help his minister.</p>

<p>As for the minister, he took a paper, and went
out. The first man he met was Mr. Lawrence,
the wealthiest person in his church.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lawrence,” he said, “we have started,
and the first load of bricks for the new church
has arrived.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Mr. Lawrence, and after a
little more talk he put down his name for quite
a sum of money. Dr. Sullivan went on telling
every one that the first load of bricks had arrived,
and it was astonishing how encouraging
those bricks were! When the congregation met
that afternoon, their pastor announced that some
hundred dollars had been raised for the church,
and that the first load of bricks had come.</p>

<p>Of course it was a good while before the
church was really built, for there were architects
and masons and carpenters to be consulted; but
it was really built, and it was not till then that
the minister told who had furnished “the first
load of bricks,” and how he really started the
whole thing.</p>

<p>And the six bricks that Robbie had brought
in his little wheelbarrow were built into the wall
of the church, and everybody thanked him for
his part of the work.</p>

<p>Now the best thing about this story is that it
is all true. The minister’s name may not have
been Dr. Sullivan, and the boy’s name may not
have been Robbie Ellsworth, and his wheelbarrow
may not have been green, but it brought
the bricks that are in the “Brick Church,” as it
is called, of one of the largest cities in the
Eastern States.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="big">F</span>ROM the further corner of the fence,
one end fastened to a bush near by,
hung a spider’s silken web, regular
as if made on geometrical principles.
In the centre of this sat a good-sized
spider, the proprietress, who had just finished
devouring the most of an unwary fly, whose
bloodless remains lay at her side. Up to
the spider came two ants—Zed and Zoo.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said the spider, looking at
them suspiciously, “for having any doubts as to
the safety of making your acquaintance. But
you have just been communicating with my
greatest enemy, the wasp, and have been watching
with heartless interest the destruction of one
of my family. I am sure I hope you have no
personal designs upon my life. The wasp is such
a very daring foe, that I fear you, even though
you are so small.”</p>

<p>“I assure you,” replied Zed, “that our interest
in the wasp’s doings was wholly due to
ignorance, and we are no friends of hers, nor
have we any design against you.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied the spider, whose name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
was Luxz, “I am very glad. I feel in a pretty
good humor this morning, having just finished
a most delicious fly. I say finished, or I would
offer you some. All spiders like flies. I had a
most unpleasant disappointment yesterday. I
was over on the window-sill of the house yonder,
and saw a large fly resting on a piece of
paper. Of course I sprang after him, but there
was no fly there! I walked over and over him,
too! One of my neighbors suggests that it was
a picture; as if an intelligent spider couldn’t tell
the difference between a picture and a fly!”</p>

<p>The two ants nodded their assent to this
highly probable statement.</p>

<p>“You spin a great deal, I suppose?” asked
Zoo.</p>

<p>“O, yes!” said Luxz; “I am as busy as can
be. I can spin little fine threads, and coarser
ones, and dance and swing all around on them.
But of course the most of my time is occupied
with work. It is a good deal of work to make
a web, although you might not think so. There
were some boys coming past here to school as I
had just finished a nice web, quite a while ago,
and they knocked it all down. I built another,
then another, but every time those wicked creatures
would destroy it, and then laugh at my
dismay. Finally my pockets were as empty as
could be, and I was all out of silk, so I had to
go and kill another spider, and occupy her web
for a time. But this I built myself.”</p>

<p>“You catch a good many flies?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. They are not very sagacious
animals, though sometimes I will find one that I
can’t entice into my web after the greatest endeavors.
We are all very cunning, but we have
to look out for some of the birds. A neighbor
of mine was swinging one morning, as fine
as could be, and a swallow came along, that
had his nest up under the eaves, and—well,
that was the last of her. The wasps, as I have
already mentioned, are very bad. If one of
them gets caught in our webs, we unfasten the
threads as quickly as we can, and let her go,
fearing that if we don’t, we shall get the worst
of it.</p>

<p>“Our threads are very convenient,” Luxz continued,
after a moment’s pause, “for we can let
one end of them float out, and they stick to
anything they touch, making a thoroughfare for
us. I remember once those same boys put me
on a chip in a large tub of water, and again
laughed at my discomfiture. But I was equal
to the emergency, and had soon spun out a thread
the outer end of which a draught of air floated
to the side of the tub, and when my tormentors
were not looking, I escaped along it. We can
fasten the end of our thread to the top of anything,
and let ourselves down by spinning out
more, or rise by pulling it in.”</p>

<p>“Have you any children?” asked Zed.</p>

<p>“O, yes!” replied Luxz, “I have some just
hatching. As you go around the corner of that
board you can see the nest—all fuzzy, like cotton.
A few are just crawling out. They are
very small as yet.”</p>

<p>Then the ants bade the spider good-day, and
went down the fence, stopping as they passed it
to see the nest, where the little wee spiders
were just taking their first few steps among the
delicate filmy threads surrounding their eggs.
How many there were!</p>

<p>A fly was the next insect which absorbed the
attention of our travellers, as he was poised on a
grease-spot at the edge of a board along which
they were walking. It was just a common
house-fly, but as they were not very familiar to
Zed and Zoo, he was an object of as great interest
to them as any which they had met in their
peregrinations.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” he buzzed, “I am searching
for something to eat. I have just been driven
out of the house yonder, by some immense people
with great cloths in their hands. They have
put up frames in the windows with wire ropes
in them, and I can’t get into that well-filled table.
There is a man there with a bald head, too,—just
the place for an enterprising fly. But these
people do hate us!”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said Zed sympathetically; “but
if you lazy flies would make homes of your own,
as ants do, and not go about where you’re not
wanted, you and others would be far more
contented.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the fly thoughtfully, “I’m sure
I don’t see why we don’t. Possibly no fly ever
thought of it. It doesn’t seem to be intended
that we should. I never could work out in the
hot sun the way you do. The people don’t
molest very often,—not as much as they’d like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to; we have too sharp eyes, and too many of
them. We each have hundreds and hundreds
of little eyes, and every one moves and looks
in a different way. It’s rather difficult to come
up behind us, as the elephant did.”</p>

<p>“How was that?” asked Zoo.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?</p>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And knocked him off that sweet-potato vine.’</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I’m not sure about the story; it’s just possible
that it may be taken from the New York
paper, but, anyway, we believe it, and often
laugh at the grasshopper.”</p>

<p>“What do you eat?” asked Zed.</p>

<p>“Anything I find, almost. Flies are not at
all particular. We can enjoy anything that any
one does. Our mouths are hollow tubes, through
which we suck whatever we wish to eat. This
is a very convenient way.”</p>

<p>“You have enemies,” remarked Zoo. “We
have just been calling on a spider who is longing
for a taste of some of you.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” cried the fly. “She is
not very near here, is she? Those spider-webs
are the great torment of our lives. I have had
several friends caught and eaten by the spiders.
The way they wind their fine, yet strong threads
about one, is something remarkable. I know a
pretty good verse about them, too:</p>

</div>

<p class="unindent">That’s real pathetic, isn’t it, now?”</p>

<p>“Very,” answered Zed and Zoo, together.</p>

<p>“I met a Southern fly once,” continued the
talkative fly, “and they have more enemies
down there than we do in the North. Take the
lizards and chameleons, for instance—”</p>

<p>“Oh! we know about them,” cried the little
ants.</p>

<p>“And then the walking-sticks,” continued the
fly, not pausing at the interruption, but rather
looking severely at his visitors; “now, a man up
here couldn’t hit on one of us with a walking-stick
if he tried all day. But it’s quite different
down there! A walking-stick is not a stick by
the aid of which people walk, but a walking-stick,
that is, a stick that walks. It is a very
strange insect, and is so exactly like the broken
twig of a tree, with the little branches and all,
that the most sagacious person can’t tell them
apart, without seeing them walk. They are
called ‘devil’s walking-sticks’ by some, and we
flies think it very appropriate, for they are dreadful
for us—that is, for Southern flies. The
people will put a walking-stick in a room full of
flies, and in a short time he will have killed
them all! Think how dreadful!”</p>

<p>“Do you know any more poetry?” asked
Zed, who was rather of a literary disposition.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I do know a real cute little song
about a fly, written by some man or other, who
evidently had a baby. I will sing it for you.”</p>

<p>And the fly buzzed:</p>

<h2>THE POPLAR ST. PANSY SOCIETY.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">By C. M. L.</span></div>


<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="71" height="135" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE Poplar Street Pansy Society began
with a large membership and every
other flattering prospect. The leaders
were wide awake, bright boys and girls
who meant success, come what might.
Everything went on finely for the first year.
Meetings were held regularly; the attendance
included nearly all the members every time, in
bad weather as well as good, and no matter
what invitations were given elsewhere to parties
or rides. The members, with rare exceptions,
were thoroughly loyal to their society.</p>

<p>This became so well known that, at length,
when entertainments were about to be given at
the same time of the society meetings its members
were passed by when the lists of invitations
were being made out, for it was commonly said
you might as well invite the man in the moon
as one of the Poplar Street Society; that they
would not leave that dear society to see the
Emperor of China pass through the city. Some
were cruel enough to say that these Pansies
just worshiped their society.</p>

<div class="caption">JENNIE.</div>
</div>

<p>In spite of all the outside
parties and sneers the
society kept right on its
way. At last it grew to
be such a power, so many
of the young folks had
joined it, that ladies, wishing
a company of the youth
at their homes, were compelled
to consult the convenience
of the Poplar
Street Pansy Society.</p>

<p>If there was to be a
meeting of the society at
a certain time, particularly
if it was to be a public
one, everything must needs
yield to it. Thither the
fathers and mothers would
go, no matter what other
attractions offered.</p>

<p>Thus this Poplar Street
Society came to be known
as the popular society.</p>

<p>But the Roman Empire
had its decline and fall.
Why should not this society?
Certain boys and
girls had come in who cared
more for place than for
progress. They wanted to
be highly thought of and
to receive the offices. On
one occasion four of them
insisted upon being chosen president. Of course
three of the four were offended and declared
they would withdraw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Some others said they must be appointed on
the programme committee and be allowed to
manage things generally or they would establish
a rival society. A few insisted that the time
had now come for a change; that the old programme
of singing, recitations, games, etc., was
poky; that a little dancing and card-playing
ought to be allowed a part of the time.</p>

<p>To this it was answered that the Poplar Street
Pansy Society was established for mental and
moral growth and not for a dancing-school or
card-party; that those who must have such things
could find them elsewhere.</p>

<p>Thus a division came. Two parties arose.
The matter was discussed in the schoolroom and
three times daily in forty or more different dining-rooms.
Many bitter things were said. The
meetings would sometimes break up in confusion.
Then some parents interfered by refusing to
allow their children to attend. The dance and
card portion withdrew. Several who wanted
the offices or wished to have the most to say,
came no more. Some had moved out of the
city.</p>

<p>So there came a time when a very few attended
the meeting. The many empty seats
filled the few present with sadness. Then came
a motion to dissolve the society; it was seconded,
put and lost by one vote only. Then it was
resolved to appoint a committee who should
confer with some wise ones and see what could
be done and report at the next meeting, or, if
they thought best, adjourn the society till better
times.</p>

<p>The committee consisted of two boys and one
girl, this girl being the very one whose perseverance
had brought the society into being and
held it together at times when it seemed ready
to go to pieces.</p>

<p>She invited her two friends to meet at her
father’s house to see what was best to be done.
Meanwhile she had done a deal of thinking for
herself and had carried the matter to her mother
for guidance.</p>

<p>Things looked dark enough for her dear society.
Her mother even doubted if anything could be
done while there was such an opposition, and
the best she could say was to let matters rest
for the present, till the dancers and others had
had their round of fun.</p>

<p>This brave girl had seen too much good in
the society, and hungered for more too deeply
to easily give it up.</p>

<p>She had a great Friend to whom all her
troubles were carried. She took this one to
Him.</p>

<p>The committee came together,—two doubting
boys and one true girl,—full of faith and purpose
to stand by the society. The boys had settled
the matter in their minds to let the society die
as things then stood; that further effort would
but result in failure, and make them a laughing-stock,—to
be laughed at was not for a moment
to be thought of,—unless there should be some
most favorable turn of affairs.</p>

<p>Thus the conference opened, two to one
against the life of the P. S. P. S., as the society
was sometimes called.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve come,” began our little
heroine to the two, after they were seated and
the moment had come for business. “These
have been pretty dark days for me; I’ve been
on the point of crying nearly all the time.”</p>

<p>“So have we,” came from the boys, “but
what’s the use crying for spilt milk! The society’s
as good as dead. Every one we’ve met
says so, and now all that’s left for us is just to
bury it respectably, and try something else.
Guess you’ve come to that conclusion, too,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“No; not I,” was the firm answer. “Our
society began with one member and here we
have three to build it up on again. I’m sure
three are more than one.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know how you make three. You
can’t count upon us. We see no chance now,
and are ready to vote to end the P. S. P. S.”</p>

<p>“I am not ready.”</p>

<p>“But we are two to your one, and you know
majorities rule.”</p>

<p>“And you, who have stood by the society so
long, are surely not going to desert it when it
needs you most?”</p>

<p>“Nothing left to desert. You see, Jennie, the
thing is gone up.”</p>

<p>And Jennie’s answer was a look of pain.
There was silence, then a sigh and audible sob
heard in the next room, where were Jennie’s
father and Uncle John. Uncle John had
come from a distant town for a visit of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
weeks. He was a lover of the boys and girls,
and when he knew the object of the meeting of
the committee was to discuss the life or death
of the Poplar Street Pansy Society, and that
Jennie’s heart was bound up in that society, he
immediately set himself, without telling any one,
to devise ways and means to come to Jennie’s
rescue.</p>

<p>So he had caught every word from the little
committee folks in the next room, and when the
crisis came and poor Jennie was about to be
out-voted, he spoke out:</p>

<p>“Jennie?”</p>

<p>“That’s my Uncle John. I wonder if he’s
heard all we’ve said,” and Jennie’s voice was
in a whisper, and quickly her handkerchief stole
to her eye to brush away the tears that had been
starting. He spoke again:</p>

<p>“Jennie?”</p>

<p>“Sir?”</p>

<p>“Cannot I counsel with your committee?”</p>

<p>“O, yes, Uncle John, do, do!” and with the
words the door flew open, and Uncle John was
introduced to the two boys.</p>

<p>After a few cheery remarks, the committee
was asked not to take any action just then, but
to call a meeting and talk the matter over once
more, with as many present as could be induced
to attend, Uncle John asking permission to be
present and make any suggestion that might
occur to him, remarking, with an assuring nod
of his head, that the Poplar Street Pansy Society
need not and should not die yet if the girls and
boys would let him keep it alive.</p>

<p>The committee looked at each other surprised;
the two boys somewhat ashamed of their part
of the conference, Jennie ready to cry for joy.</p>

<p>That night at her bedside she said: “I thank
thee, dear Lord, for hearing me in my trouble.
I thank thee for sending Uncle John just at the
right time.”</p>

<p>The boys went home in silence; but the brave
girl dreamed of a good time coming.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">AFTER a time wood became scarce. In
some parts of the country it could hardly
be had for love or money. Then what?
Ah! the Lord always provides, as he
did the lamb in place of the lad Isaac,
you remember. Some men were looking about
one day among the hills of Pennsylvania, and
they found a piece of a—wood house, sticking
out of the ground with a bit of wood in it,
though it looked no more like wood than a stone
painted black does. But it shone so brightly
that somehow they took it home and somehow,
I can’t just say how, they got it to burn. Then
they went back to the “wood house” and began
to dig, and the more they dug the larger
the wood house grew, until they could find no
limits to it. Then many of the neighbors went
at it with pickaxes and spades; then nearly all
the people of the country—and now how many
think you are getting wood there? A hundred?
Ten thousand? Guess again. And can you guess
what sort of wood it is; do you know of any one
that knows how many cords of wood are in this
house, and who piled it away there, and when?</p>

<p>It does seem as though an army of children
would have starved or frozen to death but for
that fuel; found just at the right time, you see.</p>

<p>But then, the great and loving Heavenly
Father had such a wonderful Christmas present
to surprise the world with, something better and
cheaper than this black wood.</p>

<p>Some say there is no God to take care of the
poor working men and women, and they think
one of the ways of doing it is by burning up
the property of the rich, by strikes, and such
things. Meanwhile the blessed God, whom these
persons deny, often by one little word or act,
opens up millions and millions of treasures for
the poor workers, and alas! so many never
thank him for it. “What was the treasure?”</p>

<p>I was just going to tell you. Another big
wood house bigger than all the barns, meeting-houses,
opera-houses and mills in your country!</p>

<p>The logs must be chopped and hauled; the
coal must be mined and carried on the cars, but
this new fuel just <i>comes</i>, and comes faster than
the fastest train you ever heard of! All that
is necessary is to bore into the earth in certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
places from one hundred to fifteen hundred feet
and place an iron tube into the hole, long enough
to reach your—fireplace, and touch a match to
the open end of the tube; then look out for one
of the hottest fires you ever warmed your fingers
at. But be careful lest a lot of this new wood
gets out into your room and away goes the top
of your house and—yourself with it. However,
I guess your pa will see that a first-rate plumber
puts in the fixtures. After that, no danger need
be feared from an explosion.</p>

<p>Right in the hearth will come the little flames,
by turning some screws and touching a match.
There are broken pieces of stone lying in the
fireplace. These will become hot, from red to
white. Then you’d better not handle them.</p>

<p>Now bring your cold fingers and feet, or go to
the kitchen stove and see how beautifully your
dinner is being cooked by this wonderful wood.</p>

<p>There it is, too, heating all the stores, banks,
schools, churches, and everything that will give
it a chance to come through the iron tube.
Now what say you? I guess this is <i>gas</i>.</p>

<p>Yes; I knew you’d ask that: Who found it
first, and what does it cost, and how does it
look and smell, and when will it be all used up,
and how far will it travel? However, if I
should tell you all I know about it, that would
save you the trouble of finding out yourself, one
of the very best things for you, trouble besides
the joy of finding out some things without
bothering any one to tell. Now see if you can
answer those questions yourself. This, I will
say: that Pittsburgh, Penn., knows a great deal
about this gas. Ask it.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory'>CHARLIE HOLLAND, at your service.
A well-dressed, well-mannered, pleasant-faced
boy. You feel sure you would
like him? Everybody who sees him
feels just so.</p>

<p>“His mother must be proud of him,” is a sentence
often on people’s lips. Look at him now,
as he lifts his hat politely, in answer to a call
from an open window.</p>

<p>“Charlie,” says the voice, “I wonder if I
could get you to mail this letter for me? Are
you going near the post-office?”</p>

<p>“Near enough to be able to serve you, Mrs.
Hampstead,” says the polite voice. “I will do
it with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“I shall be very much obliged, Charlie, but I
wouldn’t want to make you late at school on
that account.”</p>

<p>“Oh! no danger at all, Mrs. Hampstead. It
will not take two minutes to dash around the
corner to the office.” And, as he receives the
letter, his hat is again lifted politely.</p>

<p>“What a perfect little gentleman Charlie
Holland is,” says Mrs. Hampstead to her sister,
as the window closes. “Always so obliging;
he acts as though it was a pleasure to him to
do a kindness.”</p>

<p>Bend lower and let me whisper a secret in
your ear: it is not five minutes since that boy’s
mother said to him: “Charlie, can’t you run
upstairs and get that letter on my bureau and
mail it for me?” And Charlie, with three
wrinkles on his forehead, and a pucker on each
side of his mouth, said: “O, mamma! I don’t
see how I can! I’m late now; and the office
is half a block out of my way.”</p>

<p>And the mother said, well then he needn’t
mind, for she didn’t want him to be late at
school. So he didn’t mind, but left the letter
on the bureau, and went briskly on his way until
stopped by Mrs. Hampstead.</p>

<p>What was the matter with Charlie Holland?
Was he an untruthful boy? He did not mean
to be. He prided himself on his strict honesty.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> growing late, and he felt in a hurry,
and he hated to go upstairs. Of course it would
not do to refuse Mrs. Hampstead, and by making
an extra rush, he could get to school in time;
but the other lady was only his mother. Her
letter could wait.</p>

<p>“Only his mother!” Didn’t Charlie Holland
love his mother, then?</p>

<p>You ask him, with a hint of doubt about it
in your voice, and see how his eyes will flash,
and how proudly he will toss back his handsome
head and say:</p>

<p>“I guess I <i>do</i> love my mother! She’s the
grandest mother a boy ever had.”</p>

<p>Oh! I didn’t promise to explain Charlie’s
conduct to you; I am only introducing him;
you are to study for yourselves. Do you know
any boy like him?</p>

<h2>THE OLD BRIMMER PLACE.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class='dropcapstory'>THE air was clear and fresh; a slight
fall of snow just conveniently
stopping at the point of becoming
higher than the overshoes of the pedestrians,
lay on the ground. It was an
early fall, as the old farmers say when
there is snow at Thanksgiving, and every sign
gave promise of winter shutting in rapidly.</p>

<p>The old gray house set back from Cherryfield
high road, had its chimney smoking by break of
day, for Mother Brimmer tied on her baking
apron as soon as she had told Rosalie how to
prepare the simple breakfast “to hurry forward
those pies,” as she said.</p>

<p>“All that can be done to-day, Rosy,” she observed,
in the midst of the bustle that now ensued,
“is clear gain toward to-morrow. Always
remember that, child; don’t leave a lot of odds
and ends to do when you’re going to have company,
thinking you’ll have time. You never do;
and the last minute catches you before you know
it.”</p>

<p>“It’s such fun,” hummed the one girl of the
family, stirring the cornmeal mush in the kettle
vigorously, “to have company. I don’t ever
remember having any before.”</p>

<p>“You forget the parson coming to tea,” said
Mrs. Brimmer, bringing out her pie-plates from
the pantry. “Let me see; I shall make four
mince ones.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t company!” cried Rosy. “Mr.
Higginson isn’t; I ain’t a bit afraid of him.”</p>

<p>“No more you should be,” exclaimed Mrs.
Brimmer, setting down her pie-plates; “and
then again, child, there isn’t any call to be afraid
of any one, so long as you haven’t been doing
anything wrong.”</p>

<p>“But it scares me to think something don’t
look nice, or I don’t know how to do things,”
said Rosy.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s very silly,” observed Mrs.
Brimmer, going for her pastry-board; “do the
best you can, Rosy, and then let it go.”</p>

<p>Rosy turned her little anxious face toward
her mother, and smiled. “Anyway, this company
is to be nice, and the things will be nice,
too, I guess, ma.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try to make ’em so,” declared her
mother, energetically stirring up her mince-meat
in the stone jar.</p>

<p>“What will Miss Clorinda say to see the
goose that I’m going to roast all myself?” cried
Rosy, deserting her mush-kettle, to go over with
this important question to the baking-table.
“Say, ma?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know!” cried Mrs. Brimmer,
with pride. “She’ll say, ‘Was there ever
such a goose!’ like as not, though, Rosy.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose she really will!” cried the
girl in delight, the color coming into her cheeks.
When she looked like this, the boys, her brothers
Jack and Cornelius, always called her “Wild
Rose,” and it was their secret delight to summon
the lovely bloom in as many startling ways
as they could.</p>

<p>“But you’d better fly back to that mush,”
said Mother Brimmer presently, “and get breakfast
as you’d ought to, and not look ahead to
to-morrow. That’ll take care of itself.”</p>

<p>“So it will!” cried Rosy merrily.</p>

<p>Jack and Cornelius, now hurrying in to breakfast,
the small maid-of-all-work had to desert
her delightful anticipations of to-morrow’s good
times and fly to the work in hand. It was presently
on the table—the steaming dish of mush,
the baked potatoes, and the large pitcher of
milk, and Mother Brimmer being summoned
from her work, wiped her hands, took off her
apron, and joined the others at their simple
meal.</p>

<p>For the good woman, although her children
were “in business and doing for themselves,” as
she proudly expressed it, observed the same frugality
as when times were hard and the future
looked dark. “We won’t give up our plain
breakfasts; they’ve always done us good, and
we don’t need any other food,” she would say
when the boys urged her to have a “bit of meat
for herself, at least.”</p>

<p>“No, no; I don’t want it,” she said, “mother’s
tough and hearty. As long as I’ve such perfect
health, you needn’t worry, children.”</p>

<p>So the money that would have gone into the
butcher’s till for the beefsteak or mutton chop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
went instead into the bank to Brimmer Brothers
and Company’s credit.</p>

<p>And the economy observed in the matter of
breakfasts went into all the other details of
daily life. The only thing in which the family
indulged themselves was in the matter of books
and magazines; and occasionally Mrs. Brimmer
would send the young people off of an evening
to a good lecture or concert in the Town Hall,
or she would go with some of them, one always
being obliged to remain with Roly Poly, who
was called “the baby,” although rejoicing in
the dignity of five years.</p>

<p>The business conducted by Brimmer Brothers
and Company was a grocery and general trade
carried on in a little red building on their
grounds, that had formerly been an old tool-house,
in which the farmer who then lived in
the big gray house mended up his farming utensils,
and kept his tools when he had done the
jobs. The business was started because the
little money left by Father Brimmer when he
died had, despite all the watchful care of it,
dwindled till now there was only a pittance left.
The old weather-beaten house would last them
their lifetime, and the ground was theirs, but
the growing family would need more each year
to support them, and make them able to take
their proper place in the world. And the children,
who had silently worried over the problem,
how to help the mother they had seen working
for them early and late ever since they could
remember, were at last one day helped out by
the little old red tool-house.</p>

<p>“Here I am,” it seemed to say. “Your
mother has given me to you for a play-house;
now use me to help her.”</p>

<p>It was an inspiration in the first of it, to be
followed by hard and grinding work, much
of it in the face of half-laughing opposition
and downright sneers of friends and townsfolk.
But Brimmer Brothers and Company having
begun to face the world never once thought of
shirking any of the duties which they met there,
but just the same as if everybody believed that
they could make a success of the business, they
determined in their own minds to do so, and behaved
accordingly. And Rosy, the most timid
little thing before strangers, forgot all her fears
now, and as Company of the new concern developed
a resoluteness and self-possession that
amazed the boys.</p>

<p>All this was two years before this Thanksgiving;
and now Mother Brimmer and the successful
business firm and Roly Poly were to
have a party!</p>

<p>After the breakfast dishes were cleared away,
the boys hurrying off to the shop, as they anticipated
a rushing trade for the day, the old
kitchen began to assume the aspect of getting
ready for some great festivity, while it smelt
of spices and boiling sweets clear out beyond
the lilacs and down to the front gate. Every
passer-by must have known that it was Thanksgiving,
and suspected pies and such other accompaniments
of the national holiday at once.</p>

<p>The stoning of raisins and buttering of cake-pans
fell to Rosy to do, who was excused from
shop duty for the morning to help the mother
in her unwonted tasks; and patiently the little
girl performed it all, secretly planning, as she
waited on the busy housewife, taking the thousand
and one necessary steps in and out the
buttery and pantry, if one of her little wood-gardens
remained unsold in the shop, to take it
to dress the dinner-table on the morrow.</p>

<p>“They can’t all be sold,” thought Rosy, almost
wishing for the moment that there was not quite
such a demand for them. “If the red partridge-berries
could only stay at home, what a party
we would have!”</p>

<p>But when Cornelius ran in to dinner, Jack
staying behind to mind the shop, he shouted out
gleefully, “Rosy, every single one of your gardens
is gone, and we could have sold two more
if we’d had ’em!” Rosy gave a great sigh,
and then reproached herself for even wishing it
otherwise.</p>

<p>“Rosy’ll make more money than any of us,”
declared Cornelius, generally called “Corny,”
between his mouthfuls. “How I wish I’d
thought about fixing up roots and ferns and
such things in old cracked saucers.”</p>

<p>“But you help me,” cried Rosy. “I couldn’t
even dig the roots without you, Corny.”</p>

<p>“And me, too!” cried Roly Poly, or Primrose,
which was her real name. “I always go with
you, Rosy, you know,” and she laid down the
little bone she was slowly picking to regard her
sister gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“So you do!” cried Rosy and Cornelius together.
“I’m sure we couldn’t ever get along
without you, Pet;” whereat the baby of the
family felt happy, and smilingly resumed her
bone once more.</p>

<p>But that night a rap sounded on the outer
door, sharp and decided.</p>

<p>“Run and see who it is, Jack,” said Mother
Brimmer, looking up from her stocking-mending.</p>

<p>Jack came hurrying back, a large parcel with
white paper loosely folded over it, in his hand.</p>

<p>“It’s for Rosy,” he said, setting it down.</p>

<p>“For me?” cried Rosy, too astonished to
open it; but Cornelius helped her, and at last
the paper was torn off.</p>

<p>“It’s your old red wood-garden!” exclaimed
Corny, dreadfully disappointed, at least expecting
a big cake.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Rosy clasped her hands, and took an
ecstatic little spin in the middle of the floor.
“Now it isn’t wicked to want it!” she cried,
dreadfully excited.</p>

<p>“If I’d known you wanted to keep one,” said
Jack slowly, “so bad, I never’d sold it.”</p>

<p>“Who bought it?” asked his mother.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Higginson.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what other people do who haven’t
got such a minister, and his wife,” observed
Mrs. Brimmer, wiping her eyes, as Rosy fell to
oh-ing over her treasure, and fondling each leaf.
“Folks ought to be good who sit under their
preaching,” she added.</p>

<p>“We’ll be good to-morrow, anyway,” declared
Cornelius. “My! don’t it seem funny to go to
church in the middle of the week!”</p>

<p>But on the morrow, wasn’t that a festive
scene? The table was laid in the keeping-room,
whose door opened into the kitchen; knives and
forks were laid for seven guests: Mr. and Mrs.
Higginson, the minister and his good wife; Miss
Clorinda Peaseley, a staunch friend of the family;
old Widow Tucker and her spinster daughter
who went out tailoring, and lived down in the
Hollow; not because they would be such pleasant
additions to the party, as that Mother Brimmer
felt sure that no other invitations would be sent
to them, bidding them to a Thanksgiving dinner;
and lame Joey Clark and his sister, for the same
reason, and because the children had begged to
ask them.</p>

<p>Rosy’s wood-garden had the place of honor
in the centre of the table, and it did seem as if
there never was such a number of bright little
berries to cast a glow over the neat cloth, done
up in Mother Brimmer’s best style! How they
shone among their green leaves!</p>

<p>And the goose! The cheeks of the little
maid who cooked it rivalled her partridge berries
in coloring, at all the compliments that were
showered upon her; while the chicken pie, and
spare-rib, and plum pudding, and pies, were declared
the best ever eaten; and the hickory nuts
and butter nuts, cracked by the boys, received
most honorable mention.</p>

<p>And old Widow Tucker’s thin face began to
lose some of its worn lines, and she forgot to
make any uncharitable remarks about other people,
to which she was a little prone, and her
daughter, Miss Mary Jane, seeing her ma so
happy, came out from behind her spectacles and
began to be pleasant, too.</p>

<p>And the minister told the most delightful
stories! and when he got tired, then there was
Miss Clorinda to set the ball of conversation to
rolling again. Everybody laughed, even lame
Joey Clark, and, altogether, there was no family
party in all Cherryfield so merry and festive.</p>

<p>And as they at last arose from the table,
everybody protesting that they could not eat a
bit more, Rosy pulled her mother’s gown and
whispered, “I want to send a basketful of goodies
down to the Four Corners boys; may I, ma?”</p>

<h2>DON’T GOSSIP.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">CHILDREN, avoid this evil. I am pained
every day at seeing the work which mischief-makers
do. Some one has compared this evil
to pin-making. “There is sometimes some truth,
which I call the wire. As this passes from hand
to hand, one gives it a polish, another a point,
others make and put on the head, and at last the
pin is done.” The Bible speaks much against
mischief-making, and I would advise you to collect
all the verses in this book, bearing on this
subject, and commit them to memory, and then
I do not think you will ever be guilty of this
sin. Remember, my little friends, that you can
never gather up the mischief you may do by
gossip.</p>

<h2>WILD ANIMALS AND THE TELEGRAPH.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">SOME interesting facts have been brought
out in a paper by M. C. Nielsen of Christiana,
on the impression produced upon animals
by the resonance of the vibration of telegraph
wires. It is found that the black and green
woodpeckers, for example, which hunt for insects
in the bark and in the heart of decaying
trees, often peck inside the circular hole made
transversely through telegraph posts, generally
near the top. The phenomenon is attributed to
the resonance produced in the post by the vibration
of the wire, which the bird mistakes as the
result of the operation of worms and insects in
the interior of the post. Every one knows the
fondness of bears for honey. It has been noticed
that in mountainous districts they seem to
mistake the vibratory sound of the telegraph
wires for the grateful humming of bees, and,
rushing to the post, look about for the hive.
Not finding it on the post they scatter the stones
at its base which help to support it, and, disappointed
in their search, give the post a parting
pat with their paw, thus showing their determination
at least to kill any bees that might be
about it. Indisputable traces of bears about
prostrate posts and scattered stones prove that
this really happens. With regard to wolves,
again, M. Nielsen states that when a vote was
asked at the time for the first great telegraph lines,
a member of the Storthing said that although his
district had no direct interest in the line proposed,
he would give his vote in its favor, because
he knew the lines would drive the wolves
from the districts through which they passed. It
is well known that to keep off the ravages of hungry
wolves in winter the farmers in Norway set
up poles connected together by a line or rope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
under which the wolves would not dare to pass.
“And it is a fact,” M. Nielsen states, “that
when, twenty or more years ago, telegraph lines
were carried over the mountains and along the
valleys, the wolves totally disappeared, and a
specimen is now a rarity.” Whether the two
circumstances are casually connected, M. Nielsen
does not venture to say.—<i>Nature.</i></p>

<h2>THE BATTLE OF IVRY.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">IN 1590 the armies of Henry the Fourth, of
France, and of the Duke of Mayenne, assembled
near Ivry, which is not far from Paris. It
was in March, and the weather was very stormy.
As night came, the vast hordes of soldiers dragging
their cannon through the deep mire, took
position for the awful conflict about to open.
Henry had about twelve thousand men, and the
Duke nearly twenty thousand. Before the dawn,
Henry mounted his charger, and, riding along
his lines, addressed them in words of cheer. He
urged upon them fidelity to France and to themselves.
In conclusion he said: “If in the turmoil
of battle you lose sight of your banner,
follow the white plume on my casque; you will
find it on the road to victory and to honor.”</p>

<p>Oh! what a conflict did Ivry see that day!
My dear little friends, I never could understand
why men love war. I never could see any good
it has ever done, but, on the contrary, war and
intemperance have made this world a sad and
gloomy place. Read a full account of this
battle, and I think you will agree with me, that
war has no charms. Maddened battalions rushed
over the plain, crushing the poor wounded men.
Grapeshot mowed down whole ranks, and shrieks
of anguish echoed over the field. In a single
hour the plain was baptized in blood. Henry
came off victorious, but it was a victory dearly
bought. In the fearful retreat two thousand
were put to the sword, and many captured. I
imagine that all France was hung in mourning
after that awful day, and thousands of homes
were robbed of their treasures. Do not you
think it will be a happy day when warriors’
steeds shall be forever chained in olive groves,
and all men shall love each other? I trust so
long as we live peace, with dovelike wings, shall
brood over our beloved land!</p>

<h2>PANAMA.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">ALTHOUGH so much has been said about
the Isthmus of Panama, and the works
now being carried on there, very little mention
has been made of the town from which that district
takes its name. Englishmen should, however,
feel some special interest in it; since the
old town, founded in 1518, was destroyed by
Morgan, the celebrated buccaneer, who started
from our shores on his romantic expeditions.
The new town was built by the Spanish Governor,
Fernandez de Cordova, at some distance
from the old site, on a rocky peninsula, which
was raised artificially and protected from the
sea by a huge stone rampart, flanked on either
side by solid bastions, and so fortified by the
famous engineer, Alfonso de Villa Costa, as to be
considered the strongest place in the New World
after Carthagena. An account of the place
now given by the <i>Exploration</i>, a French paper,
relates that these stone defences are now crumbling
into ruins, with the exception of the southeast
bastion, which is still used by the inhabitants
as a favorite promenade. On the land side,
where the defences would have been most useful
in modern times, they have been purposely
destroyed; and now the town is exposed to
periodical attacks by the people of the suburbs,
who are from time to time stirred up by some
aspirant to power, and led up to the hill of Santa
Ana, which dominates the town. Having gained
this vantage ground, they engage in skirmishes
with the townsfolk, and if victorious, seize upon
the government, which they retain until subverted
by similar proceedings. The town was,
toward the end of the last century, opulent and
handsome. But its commerce was ruined by the
wars; and its inhabitants, by their carelessness,
have allowed many fine buildings to be burned.
The railway has, it seems, restored some of its
importance to the place; and much more is, of
course, expected from the canal now projected.</p>

<h2>DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">THE subject of our sketch became one of
England’s most learned men. He was born
in Lichfield, in 1709, and died in 1784. He
once made a dictionary of our language; he
also wrote “The Rambler,” “Rasselas,” and
“The Idler.”</p>

<p>I want to relate to you a little story of him
when a small boy. His father kept a bookstand,
and one day he said, “Samuel, I am so feeble, I
want you to take my place at the stand.”</p>

<p>But the proud boy refused, and the sick father
then started off, only saying, “Well, if you can
treat your sick father thus, I am sure you will
think of it when I am dead and gone.”</p>

<p>His conscience, however, soon began to trouble
him. All day he saw his poor father, sick and
feeble, sitting at the stall, and he said to himself,
“Poor father! how his head will ache.
I am so sorry I did not go.”</p>

<p>This unkindness the boy never could forget,
and years after, though surrounded by the great
of England, it would often recur to him.</p>

<p>Many years passed by, and one day an aged
man made his way through the market crowd at
Uttoxeter. He stopped at the place which fifty
years before had been occupied by the book-seller,
and the old gentleman was heard to say:</p>

<p>“Yes; this is the very spot—the very spot!”</p>

<p>It was the great and illustrious man of England,
in whose heart still lingered the remembrance
of his cruelty to his poor father.</p>

</div>

<p class='dropcapstory'>IT is time for Baby Elizabeth to go to
bed. She does not want to go to bed.
She shakes her head and says, “No bed!
No bed!” Her little mouth is puckered
up like a round O; here is a big tear in
each blue eye. Does Baby want to stay up all
night? Shall mamma leave her sitting on the
floor all the dark night? No, no! Little mice stay
up all night, and run about and nibble and squeal;
but dear babies must go to their soft beds.</p>

<p>See! the sun has gone to bed. The little
pink clouds are lying down in the sky. The
white lilies have gone to sleep. The birdies
have gone up in the tree to bed. They are
singing a little song to baby. Hark! What
do they say? “Go to bed, bed, bed. Good-night,
little E-liz-a-beth! Good-night!”</p>

<p>Now baby smiles. She is good. She will
have on her long white gown. She folds her
little hands and says, “Now I lay me.” Mamma
puts her in her white crib. In one little minute
her eyes are shut. Little Elizabeth is asleep.</p>

<p>In the morning early the sun will get up quick.
The white lilies will wake up and wash their
faces in dew. The birdies will open their eyes.
They will say, “Peep, peep! Good-morning,
Baby! Get up, up!” Then Baby’s eyelids will
open; she will smile and show her six white teeth.
All day long the sun will shine. The lilies will
grow. The birds will sing, and little Elizabeth
will be sweet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Last</span> year there were in Iowa fifty-five counties
without a single occupant for their jails, during
the twelve months. It is in Iowa, you know,
that they have the prohibition law which “does
not prohibit.” It does seem to make a difference.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> some towns in Georgia have succeeded
in getting the prohibition of the liquor traffic, a
minister from one of them writes, “The results
are marvelous. The trade of the town has been
more than doubled. I do not know a single
merchant who would not vote against the liquor
traffic purely on business grounds.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">A laborer</span> was recently fined for allowing
his dog to drink beer, which made the animal
savage. The judge thought it was the man’s
fault for allowing his dog to drink. Why
shouldn’t a dog have a right to drink beer if it’s
given him? How can appetite be controlled?
This question has been asked: “If that laborer
was under obligation to keep his dog from drinking
beer and hurting people, ought we to permit
men to receive liquor, and injure themselves
and their fellow-men?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">I wonder</span> if the Pansies have been posted
about “rubber grapes”? Little rubber bags
made to look exactly like large beautiful grapes;
but what do you think fills them, instead of the
delicious fruit which God has made? Why,
brandy, or whiskey, or wine, or whatever liquor
the buyer prefers! Think of it! The circular
describing them says one great advantage is,
“that travellers can refresh themselves in this
way without exciting observation.” Can they?
Suppose we make that part hard for them;
thirty thousand Pansy Blossoms with their eyes
wide open are not going to be cheated by rubber
grapes. Of course every boy and girl will see
to it that no miserable humbug who pretends to
be a “fruit dealer” gets any of their money for
his cheating grapes. But isn’t Satan smart, and
cunning, and busy? Really, it becomes us to
keep our eyes very wide open indeed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Who</span> among us has ever visited the school for
Indians in Carlisle, Pa.? If any Pansy Blossom
has been there, I wish he or she would write us
a letter about the school. It is a very interesting
place; four hundred and fifty scholars, boys and
girls; the girls in navy-blue dresses and cloaks,
the cloaks lined with scarlet, the boys in military
dress. With their very bright eyes, and their
very black hair, I think they must make a handsome
picture.</p>

<p>Industrious people are they; the cooking is
done entirely by the pupils; the clothing is all
made by them; they even make their own shoes!
They are very good scholars; some of them
really brilliant.</p>

<p>You wonder how they get time to study, with
so much work to be done; that is all nicely
planned for them. Half the pupils go to school
in the morning, while the other half are at work
in the sewing-room, the pantry, the harness shop,
the printing office, the carpenter’s room, and the
like. In the afternoon these two divisions change
places; the students work, and the workmen
turn students.</p>

<p>Think what a little while ago these boys and
girls were roaming through the forests, sleeping
on the ground, their only dress old blankets
wrapped about them; learning to be dangerous
enemies to all the white race! Now some of
them are Christians, and all are well-behaved
and industrious. Who will remember to pray
daily for the Indian School at Carlisle?</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Blossoms</span>:</p>

<p>I have a very nice plan for the year. I wonder
who of you will join me? A Bible Band.
That is what I now want to form. I will select
and have printed in each <span class="smcap">Pansy</span> a list of readings
for each day in the month. How many of
my Blossoms will engage to read the day’s portion
with me, and write out in little blank books
prepared for the purpose, answers to the following
questions:</p>

<p>1. What is there in this reading that I ought
especially to remember?</p>

<p>2. Is there a direction for me to follow, if so,
what?</p>

<p>3. Is there something for me to avoid, if so,
what?</p>

<p>How can I make these verses help me through
this day?</p>

<p>Now the way I am going to plan it is to read
over the verses, and make my report in my little
blank book before I leave my room in the morning.
Perhaps that will not be a convenient time
for all of you. Perhaps the little people who cannot
yet read nor write, will have to wait for
mamma’s or papa’s or sister’s leisure hour, to get
help. But I wish all who could would join me
in the morning before going down stairs; then,
after the reading, we will kneel down and ask
God to help us remember the verses all day.</p>

<p>I would like to have each member of the
P. S. who will join this Bible Band, send me a
letter addressed to Winter Park, Florida, giving
his or her promise to obey the rules of the Band
as given here. To all such I will send a little
card for their Bible bookmark with the name of
the reader written on the back, and the date of
the pledge. I shall keep a roll of all members
of the Bible Band. At the end of each month
I should be glad to have a copy of what you
wrote in your little blank books. If you like,
you might get a large sheet of paper, the first of
the month, and make a copy for me each day,
sending it to me at the close of the month.</p>

<p>I shall keep a list of those reports, and, at the
close of the year, I will publish the names of
those members who have reported each month,
and send them each a little token of my pleasure
because of their faithfulness.</p>

<p>Now I wonder how large a Band I shall have?
Of course I will keep you informed through
<span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> of its size and growth, and send
you words of greeting. I think a great many
of you will join me. I hope so. It will be very
pleasant to think of my Blossoms reading and
thinking each day about the same Bible verses.
Who will be the first to send in his name, and receive
the bookmark?</p>

<p class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Lovingly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Pansy</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>P. S.—If any of you know of something
unusually nice, which happened at Thanksgiving
time, write us an account of it.</p>

<p><i>Lucy May Quint.</i> If all the Pansies were
as busy as my little friend in Whitefield how
very busy I should be adding names to <span class="smcap">The
Pansy</span> roll. Many thanks, my dear. To make
your meetings good will require a busy Lucy,
thinking, reading, planning, conversing with parents
and others, praying Jesus for guidance
and comfort, never despairing, no matter what
happens to spoil your meetings.</p>

<p>Keep gathering for your meetings, a crumb
in this book or paper; another from a talk with
some one; and so on. Thus you will always
have something on hand.</p>

<p>You had a “nice,” “splendid” time in the
church on Children’s Day, amid flowers and
singing-birds, evergreens, and, best of all, a good
sermon.</p>

<p>It is right to join the church. Now be true,
dear, to your covenant, for Jesus’ sake. Don’t
let any one who knows you doubt as to whether
you are a Christian.</p>

<p><i>Christiana Lacy.</i> No, the Editor did not
forget Sevenfold Trouble, but “Uncle Sam”
somehow forgot to get it from the writer to the
printer. The mail does not always behave as it
should.</p>

<p>Yes; I have read some of Miss Alcott’s works.</p>

<p>You and your friend Jennie seem to have a
good standing in school. I am glad to hear
good things of every Pansy.</p>

<p><i>Alice</i> of Minn. “At the farm.” No wonder
you like it ever so much; in the orchard, where
you have a swing; down at the brook, where
you try to catch a speckled trout; among the
sheep and cows; riding on hay or wheat from
field to barn; then sweet bread and sparkling
butter!</p>

<p>As for the dishwashing, how you three girls
do chatter while you are at it, and boast as to
whose cups and saucers are wiped cleanest. If
you will send a copy of the Queer Story, corrected,
I can tell if it be right.</p>

<p><i>Ruth Kimball.</i> Hunting eggs; boating among
pond lilies; at Cedar Bend Farm; with such a
dear companion as Alice must be, what a happy
girl you are. Well, child, make other hearts
sunny, too, won’t you?</p>

<p><i>Gertrude Burgess.</i> None but perfect ones
on the Queer Story appears in my report.
Many come within one of it; that is a failure
all the same as one hundred. See? “A miss is
as good as a mile.” So, look your work over
and over and over before you send it. Thus
you will certainly do perfect work some day.
Meanwhile the effort will be a—school to you.
You are a blessed girl to be fighting so bravely
against that fault. Have you learned how to
lean your weakness upon Jesus’ might?</p>

<p><i>Lydia Sewell.</i> The pansy on the card is
larger than many, but no larger than some I’ve
seen. By careful culture they grow to great
size. Your corrected Queer Story is well done,
yet with a few errors. It would be rather unusual
if every particular had been right. Still,
if you are a girl of good metal, you will certainly
tug away at this spelling business till you
will know the right as readily as you now know
your mamma’s face from five thousand others.
Keep on and show yourself a true Pansy soldier.</p>

<p><i>Lydia I. Boring.</i> Your Queer Story is
within one of perfection. So you need not be
cast down. Some have made a dozen mistakes.
I guess you will be A No. 1 one on the next
Queer Story.</p>

<p><i>Adella F. Coy.</i> Am glad you are pleased to
think so kindly of your Pansy picture. I wonder
if you have the picture of the Lord engraven
on your heart and often look tenderly upon it
through the eye of faith and love. Let’s never
grow too old to delight in leading and blessing
the little ones. You rejoice me in what you
say of the badge. Many others say the same
thing. If you will send me a corrected copy of
the Queer Story I will examine it.</p>

<p><i>Helen S. Sloan.</i> See above about the Queer
Story. You “Busy Bees” made $127. The
hospital will think that sweet as honey. You
must write D. Lothrop Company, Boston, Mass.,
about the “prizes.” They will explain.</p>

<p><i>Mary E. Simpson.</i> At your request, I hand
your letter to R. M. Alden. I guess he will not
throw it into the waste-basket.</p>

<p>Charlie Compher lives in Leesburg, Va. He
will be glad to get a letter from you.</p>

<p>The country is a blessed place. Isn’t it queer
that so many country boys and girls don’t think
so, but are discontented and want to get to the
city, feeling sure that the city will make them
happy? Contentment, my dear Mary, is a
precious possession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-news" id="Page_4-news">[4n]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nannie Johnson.</i> You are eleven years old.
Now if you live to be seven times that and each
day “grow in grace,” what a beautiful old lady
you will be. Of course you will outgrow “carelessness”
the first month, and have plenty of time
to pick up after mamma, instead of her doing it
after you; and the “pony” and “parrot” and
“dog” and “dear little baby sister,” and everybody
else, I guess, will be glad.</p>

<p><i>K. G. Boring.</i> A capital account, yours, of
your Fourth of July. I can almost see you at
the parade, and I’m so glad you got home safely
from the crowds and the tramp of horses and
that your fingers are not blown off. Rockets
and Roman candles seen from the house-top!
Balloons, too! Happy child! But what will
you say when you see the great Lord coming in
the clouds? How rejoiced you will be if you
are His at His coming.</p>

<p><i>May Cameron.</i> Let me commend you for
finding so many mistakes in the Queer Story. I
must see your work to determine its correctness.
As to faults: Many are temper faults; many,
disorder; many, teasing, answering back; “wait
a minute;” biting nails, etc.</p>

<p>Remember me to Mr. Doane. You seem to
be a wide-awake Band of Hope, with your
meetings, “Mizpah,” flowers, and care of the
sick. To be busy for the Saviour is to be safe
from Satan.</p>

<p><i>Charlie M. Ritter.</i> You are very kind to
remember the organ. I wish I could say something
to make everything green and beautiful
about you. But your turn will come. Wait on
the Lord, be of good courage. He hears the
young raven when it cries. What a delightful
time you must have had on Children’s Day.</p>

<p><i>Elma Holmes.</i> And while you wear your
badge here and there, be sure that you so live
that your mother and all the dear ones at home
can say, “Our Elma does what she professes.”</p>

<p><i>Edith G. Grant.</i> I shouldn’t wonder if your
Queer Story was correct. Let me see a copy
now. Allie will soon learn other good things
besides “cutting kindling-wood,” perhaps to
read <span class="smcap">Pansy</span> or Bible stories when mamma is
tired. How I should love to visit you in your
summer home in “beautiful Tullahoma.” Instead,
I went to beautiful Ashville, N. C., in
September.</p>

<h3>IN MEMORIAM.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">ANOTHER Blossom transplanted into the
garden of God. Herbie Baily of Madison,
Wis., at the age of ten, July 6th, passed
away. With his parents he was attending a
Fourth of July celebration, when an accidental
ball struck him. Nothing serious was feared
till two days later, when, at 8 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, he rushed
into the house, screaming: “My head! My head!
I shall die!” At 11 he breathed his last.
Now, can you wonder that this dear boy, “so
tender and quick to sympathize with any one in
trouble and pain,” to whom “nothing was so
charming as the ‘Story of the Bible,’ who delighted
in everything pertaining to the life of
Christ”—do you wonder that the mother says:
“It seems as if I cannot bear his loss?”</p>

<p>Maybe now some loving heart will be prompted
to write a word of sympathy to Herbie’s mother,
Mrs. A. S. Baily.</p>

<h3>MIRZA ALI’S LETTER.</h3>

<div class="unindent">
<span class="smcap">My Spiritual Teacher</span>:</div>

<p><i>Dear, magnanimous Mr. Wright:</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span>: I hope your existence is safe and you
have no bodily ailment. Second: If you wish
to inquire my health, I thank God, I and my
mother and my sister are very well, and we are
thanking to our Lord and Saviour in return for His
gifts. My words will not be finished if I want
to count the gifts of our God. It is only sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-news" id="Page_5-news">[5n]</a></span>
to write that He gave His beloved Son,
Jesus Christ, and saved us from death.</p>

<p>If you wish to acquire of circumstances of
gentlemen and ladies, the missionaries, thank be
God, all they are safe and busy to cause to reach
the good news to the multitudes.</p>

<p>Their families and ladies are safe. Our school
and the teacher, Baroon Wahan, and the scholars
are safe; every day is Baroon Wahan busy to
teach them. They learn the means of holy books.</p>

<p>I, ownself also, every day in the mornings am
busy to give lessons in Turkish to my dear Sir
Mr. Whipple, agent of the American Bible Society.
Other times I am in telegraph office.
There I write the subjects; there I am busy till
night and night we finish. These days I give
lessons in English to the son of chief of telegraph,
and both the son of Aga Mirza Abdul
Ali, the doctor. I am sorry I have no dictionary
from Persian to English. When I want to
translate a book from Turkish to English it is
not possible. I remain unable and become unequal.
If I have this dictionary I hope I will
spread English abroad. You are my benefactor;
you are my kind and merciful friend.</p>

<p>If you have not any more Dictionary and you
have one only and it is necessary for yourself
also, you cannot send (it) for me. You promise
to me that you write to Constantinople or America.
They send for me. You calculate it present,
given at Festival time to me. I hope you
desperate not me, but you will help me....
I am expecting for answer. I hope you will
send me that book and you will make me glad
and happy. If you have order, write me. I
will execute and perform it. I will obey to all
your commands. The grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with you. Amen! And God may
increase your love for Jesus, His beloved Son.
Amen! If you find and see some mistake shut
your eyes from my faults. Excuse me, sir. It
is the first letter I wrote in English.</p>

$1.00. To Pansy Society 60 cents. A lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6-news" id="Page_6-news">[6n]</a></span>
book within and without; just the thing for a
gift. It is not simply amusing; every child
who reads it cannot fail of being helped by its
pure, sweet lessons. We quote a few pages
from “Lisa’s Christmas”:</p>

<p>“The next day the great question was, what
the lamb’s name would be.</p>

<p>“Lisa proposed calling it Eulalie, for that was
the name of her friend’s cat, and it seemed to
her an especially fine name. But the boys did
not like it. It was too long. Kurt proposed
Nero, as the big dog at the mill was called. But
Lisa and Karl were not pleased with this name.</p>

<p>“In despair they went to their mother, who
suggested he should be called ‘Curlyhead,’ and
Curlyhead he was from that forth.</p>

<p>“The little creature soon became a great pet for
the children. They took him out for a frolic whenever
they had a few spare moments. Sometimes
they went to the pasture and Kurt and Karl
would search for rich, juicy clover leaves to
bring him, while Lisa sat on a bank with the
little creature’s head in her lap.</p>

<p>“Whenever a child was sent on an errand to
the mill or to the baker’s, the lamb must go, and
he listened so intelligently to all the conversation
his companion addressed to him that it was
evident he understood every word. He grew
round as a ball, and his wool was as white and
pretty as if he was always in his Sunday dress.</p>

<p>“The beautiful sunny autumn was drawing to
a close, Christmas was coming, Kurt and Karl
disclosed all their cherished dreams to Curlyhead,
and assured him he should have his share
of holiday presents.</p>

<p>“Lisa had a particular friend, Marie, who
lived in the great farmhouse on the way to the
Zillesback. Lisa was very anxious to visit this
friend, for she could talk over her prospects for
Christmas more fully with her than with her
brothers. She had permission to go on her first
free afternoon, and when the time came she was
so impatient to start, that she could hardly hold
still long enough for her mother to tie on her
warm scarf. Then she ran bounding off, while
her mother watched her until she was half-way
down the hill; then she turned and went into
the house again.</p>

<p>“At that moment it came into Lisa’s mind
that Curlyhead would enliven the way if her
brothers had not already taken him. She quickly
turned around, ran back to the barn and took
out Curlyhead. Together they ran down the
hard path where the bright autumn leaves were
dancing about in the wind. They soon reached
the end of their journey, where Lisa and her
friend where quickly lost in deep conversation,
walking up and down on the sunny plot of
ground in front of the house, while Curlyhead
nibbled contentedly at the hedge.</p>

<p>“The two friends refreshed themselves occasionally
with pears, and juicy, red apples, which
grew in great abundance on the farm.</p>

<p>“Marie’s mother had brought out a great
basketful, and Lisa was to carry home what
were left. When it was time for Lisa to go
home, Marie accompanied her a little way, and
they still had so much to say that they were in
sight of Lisa’s home before they knew it. Marie
quickly took leave of her, and Lisa hurried up
the path. It was already dark. Just as she
reached the house the thought flashed through
her mind like lightning: ‘Where is Curlyhead?’</p>

<p>“She knew she had taken him with her. She
had seen him nibbling the hedge and then she
had entirely forgotten him.</p>

<p>“In a most dreadful fright she rushed back
down the mountain again. ‘Curlyhead, Curlyhead,
where are you? Oh, come, come!’</p>

<p>“But all was still. Curlyhead was nowhere
to be seen. Lisa ran back to the farmhouse.
There was a light already in the window of the
sitting-room, and she could look in from the
stone steps by the house. They were all at
the supper-table; father, mother, Marie and her
brothers and the servants. The old cat lay on
the bench by the stove; but nowhere was there a
trace of Curlyhead to be seen as Lisa peered into
all the corners. Then she ran around the house
into the garden, around the hedge, again into
the garden, and along the inside of the hedge,
calling ‘Curlyhead, come now, oh! come, come!’</p>

<p>“All in vain; there was no sight or sound of
the lamb. Lisa grew more anxious. It grew
darker and the wind howled louder and louder,
and almost blew her from the ground. She
must go home. What should she do? She did
not dare to say she had lost Curlyhead. If she
could see her mother alone first!”</p>

<p>These Glues are used in the Smithsonian Institute at Washington for all its

CAN—which has the following advantages: The top can be turned
on or off readily by the fingers—each Can has brush fastened to the

enables the amateur or artisan to carry a small can in
the pocket ready for immediate use, without danger of soiling from
brush or can. The NEW PATENT CAN is in 3 sizes:—Half-pint,

<div class="adtitle3">
AN IMPORTANT ADVANCE IN SUNDAY
SCHOOL BOOKS AND UNEXPECTED
HELP IN PICKING THEM
OUT.</div>

<p>Sunday School books have been growing
better and better for many years; and yet
we think they are scarcely keeping pace with
the general forward movement. Indeed the
improvement in Sunday School books has
been largely brought about by mixing with
them books designed for wider use.</p>

<p>Why not then widen the word to cover the
fact, and get such other books for Sunday
Schools as are fit for rising young people,
books to help them rise?</p>

<p>That is the direction in which D. Lothrop
Company has been working for several years;
and its Sunday School books are largely
made up of reading and pictures by no means
confined to religious subjects. Now it goes
still further in the direction of the popular
tendency, and offers for Sunday Schools a
separate list of books not often thought of
for that purpose.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that children, especially
boys, are apt to prefer a library where all sorts
of books are within their reach. Such browsing
unrestrained is apt to lead downward
rather than up. But why not let the Sunday
School library have the attraction without
the danger? Why not afford the delight of
inspiring, instructive, helpful literature in
some of the books and religious teaching in
others without the popular trash?</p>

<p>So two separate lists of books for the Sunday
School library: one of modern (not
“goody-goody” or stupid) Sunday School
books, the other of secular books for the
rising young.</p>

<p>These lists are arranged according to the
relative acceptability of the books as shown
in the main by the numbers called for. (1)
religious Sunday School books; and (2) secular
Sunday School books.</p>

<p>The books in both lists are arranged in
the order of their acceptability. And so the
lists are a help in choosing books. The
majority vote may not be an infallible standard;
but is there a better, especially when
the voters are well-informed about what they
are voting on?</p>

<p>The man who makes and sells a thing is
the man who knows its quality; for the
opinions of those who use it get around to
him, and that very promptly. These lists
are made with just that knowledge.</p>

<p>First and foremost of the decidedly religious
books are the Pansy books. Pansy herself
is a leader of children. She opens her
mouth—they are eager to catch her lightest
word. She raises her hand—instinctively
up go theirs. The secret of such a power
as that is sympathy, feeling together.</p>

<p>So in her books. She enters into their
smallest experiences. The boys and girls of
her books, the children of her brain, are just
like her readers, natural flesh and blood;
not life-like but real, just as real as you are
yourself. They live in their world with the
rest of us; have their ups and downs, perplexities,
such as come to us all; and they
win. So shall we who read!</p>

<p>That is inspiration. The reader becomes
the actor, the hero, the heroine. Happy
the writer who uses such power as that for
helping, guiding, building up.</p>

<p>There are more than a hundred “Pansy
books,” mostly by Pansy herself, a few by one
or two helpers, a few by others altogether.
They constitute, we may fairly say, the very
highest class of traditional Sunday School
books. They belong to the highest order of
Sunday School work.</p>

<p>D. Lothrop Company, Boston, is just now
getting out these lists of religious and secular
Sunday School books, arranged with a
view of marking their relative popularity.
The Pansy books are at the top of the religious
list, and Arthur Gilman’s History of
the American People heads the secular list.</p>

<p><i>Wide Awake:</i> library, study, play-house, life at home and abroad,
companionship of the wise and good; $2.40.</p></div>

<p>Think of a life not only unhurt by wrong reading and
pictures, but helped by right reading and pictures all the
way through! It <i>is</i> a neighborly act!</p>

<p>We make such Terms as you never heard of—for work.</p>

<p class="adtitle3">Who Skips This Page Will Please Skip All</p>

<div class="sidenote">What premiums
are
and to whom
they are due</div>

<p>Premiums are pay for work and nothing else.
That work is getting new subscriptions. It is
done when you send the names, addresses and
money. Then you take your choice of the things
in the List.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why we
pay so much</div>

<p>This work is of great importance to us, no
matter how little there is to be done in your neighborhood.
We pay for it <i>all the money there is;</i>
we pay in such a way as to make it more to you
than it is to us, especially if you happen to live
where good new things are hard to get, where
the stores are stocked with things that are going
out of use instead of with things that are coming
into use.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The best
things in the
list</div>

<p>We put in the List the best we can get and the
best we can get for the money: some things because
it is worth your while to know about them;
others to answer wants we know exist—we put in
nothing to be ashamed of. Some things are commonplace;
not all are new or hard to get; but
those we emphasize are worthy of careful study.</p>

<p>To be in the List at all is commendation. To be
described is high commendation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When premiums
are
due</div>

<p>Premiums are due when the names and money
are here, and may be taken at any time thereafter,
the sooner the better for us. You can have
them right along as you earn them, or wait a little
and have more together and save a part of the
cost of transportation; but the sooner you take
them the surer you are of getting them. Some
will be gone by and by.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Who pays
for transportation</div>

<p>All costs for freight, express and postage are
paid by receiver, except postage on books, magazines
and a few small things on which the postage
is only a cent or two.</p>

<p>The postage on mailable things is stated in the
List except as above. [When the postage is not
stated: if the thing weighs only an ounce or two,
we pay the postage; but, if heavier, it must go by
express.] It is often true that mailable things go
for less by express. We send the cheapest way,
if we know it.</p>

<p>Some things are sent direct from the makers to
save expense.</p>

<p>Everything over four pounds, too big for the
mail, or for any reason unmailable, goes by express;
and you pay the freight on receipt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How much
the cost of a
package is
by express</div>

<p>You can generally find out about how much by
guessing the size and weight and inquiring at your
express office.</p>

<p>You can economize freights to some extent by
having several things in one package.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Who is responsible</div>

<p>We pack with care and deliver to carrier in good
condition. That is all we can do. Beyond that
the risk is yours. We register packages going by
mail if you send the registry fee, ten cents a package,
in addition to postage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What is a
new subscription</div>

<p>We pay for new subscriptions; not for renewals.
What is the difference? A new one is that of a
family not on our list before.</p>

<p>We pay premiums in good faith. We expect
them to be earned in good faith. A subscriber
may stop one magazine and become a new subscriber
to another; but change of a magazine
from one name to another in a family is not a new
subscription. Your own subscription (if new)
may count with others (not alone) for premiums.
We have got to draw the line somewhere. We
don’t reckon too closely, nor suspect bad faith too
readily. We prefer to deal a little generously; but
we don’t intend to be really imposed upon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Direct to
D. Lothrop
Company</div>

<p>To be entitled to premiums you must send subscriptions
direct to the publishers, not to another
agent. We don’t pay twice for the same subscription.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Whose
agent you
are</div>

<p>You are entrusted with money for us by the subscribers
you get. You are their agent, not ours.
Be faithful to them. Send their names and money
as soon as you get them. You are responsible to
them till we get the names, addresses and money
together. Then you are free.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When a
subscription
begins</div>

<p>Subscriptions begin at any time. If you neglect
to name a date, we guess as well as we can.</p>

<p>The volumes begin as follows: <i>Wide Awake</i>,
December and June; <i>Chautauqua Young Folks’
Journal</i>, December; <i>Pansy</i>, November; <i>Our Little
Men and Women</i>, January; <i>Babyland</i>, January.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Requirements</div>

<p>No deviation in prices; no credit (send name,
address and money together); remit by post-office
money order, by American Express Company’s
money order, by registered letter or by bank check
(postage stamps may be sent in registered letters
for change); write plainly and fully; give subscribers’
full addresses (they may be different);
sign your name and give your full address in every
communication.</p>

<p>The foregoing relates to premiums sent within
the United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beyond
the United
States</div>

<p>To the British North American Colonies other
premiums have to be sent by express, the receiver
paying whatever costs the tariff may impose; but
magazines and books may be sent to these colonies
by mail. There is a duty on books; not on magazines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Premiums
for sale</div>

<p>Things in the List are also sold for money, payment
in advance, no discount, no charge for packing,
sent at receiver’s cost and risk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Delays</div>

<p>Wait for return mail and a week besides before
you conclude your letter or our reply has gone
astray; then write particulars: date of your sending,
how you remitted, how much.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first
thing to do</div>

<p>The first step to take is to send us 15 cents for
specimen copies of all five magazines, subscription
blanks and other helps.</p>

<p>There is no better for less
than $10. It is not good
enough to take portraits.
It is good enough for views
containing persons or
groups.
That is, it
gives attitudes
and
aspects
perfectly;
not the
fine details of expression and feature. For ten cents
we send two specimen photographs (largest size, 3x4
inches) taken with it.</p>

<p>An average boy or girl of twelve years can use it successfully
and make about as good pictures with it as
with any $10 camera.</p>

<p>The outfit consists of a small camera covered with
imitation morocco, six rapid dry plates, two japanned-iron
trays, two bottles of developer, package of hypo-sulphite
of soda, printing-frame, six sheets of silvered
and six of blue-print paper, bottle of toning solution,
dozen card mounts, plate-lifter, sheet of ruby paper,
directions for making a cheap ruby lamp, and full
instructions for every part of the work. Weight about
3½ pounds; postage 60 cents—express may be less.</p>

</div>

<p>It is with gratification as complete as it was unexpected
that we put this machine in the list.</p>

<p>It prints more neatly and perfectly than the Remington;
not so fast and not so easily. A scholar’s type-writer;
a type-writer for business not requiring speed
or amount of work. Whoever wants a type-writer but
has too little use for it to justify paying a hundred
dollars for it, he is the man or woman, boy or girl for
whom this machine is exactly right.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to take the time to acquire facility with
a type-writer that amounts to nothing after he has
learned it. The limit of the value of the “World” is
its speed; which is from twenty to thirty words a
minute. We hear that sixty words a minute has been
attained. We are sure of thirty. Weight in box 5 lbs.</p>

<p>We are not permitted to sell it for money; only with
subscriptions.</p>

treatment than those of any other style of wringer.</p>

<p>There is as much difference in hammocks as in “easy”
chairs. Some are anything but easy. Nobody knows
how easy a hammock can be till he has gone to sleep in
this Perfection.</p>

<p>There is an outside door-mat so good that every civilized
door where muddy feet have to come—there are
thousands of such—will have it sooner or later. And
one is enough; for it lasts forever.</p>

<p>There is nothing else a tenth so good. It almost
keeps itself clean. A jar dislodges the worst and thickest
of mud.</p>

<p>The Hartman
steel-wire mat.
An open
springy texture
of wire to
scrape on—galvanized
spring-steel
wire—no rust,
no wear—like
a wire mattress but thicker and closer. You scrape on
it, step on it, stamp on it, tramp on it fearlessly. The
stickiest mud becomes innocent dust underneath and is
swept away next morning. A pretty full account of it
sent on request.</p>

<p>The price of the mat is $4, more or less according to
size. The $4 size is a good one, 22x30 inches. You
earn it by getting $4.50 in new subscriptions. To
save express we send it from the manufacturer’s
nearest office nearest to you.</p>

<p>The makers are doing their best
to supply the quick demand from
the cities. They would be overwhelmed
if the country were
equally ready. But where is a
perfect mat most useful, where
there are pavements or no pavements?</p>

<p>Bissell Carpet-sweeper. Price $3; for $3.25 in new

<p>Not a housewife rich enough to own a carpet would
do without a sweeper if she knew how great relief a
good one brings on sweeping and dusting day.</p>

</div>

<p>It sweeps cleaner than a broom and easier, makes no
dust, and does nine-tenths of the work, leaving only an
inch or two along the sides of a room and little corners—these
must be swept with a broom—and it drops the
dust with a touch on a spring as shown in the picture.
That band around the sweeper is a rubber cushion to
keep it from bruising furniture.</p>

<p>Three-fourths of all the carpet-sweepers in the world
are made by one factory, the Bissell Carpet-Sweeper
Company, Grand Rapids, Michigan. Of course they
make good ones. The fact is, they control the really useful
inventions and nobody else is allowed to make good
sweepers at all. But their prices are fair.</p>

<p>Kerosene-brick
for
burning kerosene
in any
cook-stove,
heater or
open fire-place, as kindler or fuel. Porous fire brick.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 268px;">
<img src="images/illus140.jpg" width="268" height="92" alt="brick on fire" />
</div>

<p>We do not know (at the time of writing) its limit of
value, having only just now got it. It is safe—no
doubt of that. It is the best kindler ever discovered—no
doubt of that. But to what extent it is going to be
used for summer fuel and fuel for transient occasions
of all sorts we do not know. It is a new thing of very
great importance everywhere. We therefore state
what we know of it carefully.</p>

<p>The reason why it does not explode is that the oil is
fast in the pores of the brick and can’t get out, except
as it is slowly driven out by the fire. Kerosene lamps
are dangerous; but you are careful with them. There is
no possible way in which the kerosene-brick can explode.
The only harm that can come of it is through
keeping a larger supply of kerosene for fuel then you
would keep for light. The answer to that is that a
barrel is no worse than a pint. Either is enough to
blow a house into kindling-wood.</p>

<p>The reason why it is the best kindler is that it is the
cheapest—in other respects it is not much better than
pitch-pine.</p>

<p>Tradesmen are likely to overstate the cheapness of it;
but it is very cheap—how cheap depends, of course,
on the cost of your kerosene; and that is so different in
different parts of the country that we cannot give the
cost of using the kerosene-brick. It saves its cost in
wood perhaps ten times over.</p>

<p>It makes smoke and soot; but they go up chimney.</p>

<p>The first cost of the kerosene-brick is as follows:<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

</p>

<p>And you want a peculiar sort of tongs (see the cut) for
handling the kerosene-brick. Price 25 cents; for 30
cents in new subscriptions.</p>

<p>To save express charges, we ship from the manufacturer’s
nearest place of business (nearest to you) wherever
that may be.</p>

<p>There is going to be a kerosene-brick of a shape to
imitate wood for use in open fire-places. Not yet made
and may not be so handy to fill. By the way, we haven’t
told how to fill the kerosene-brick.</p>

<p>“No. 1” above means a tin can with three small kerosene-bricks
in it. You take out one of the bricks, fill
the can with kerosene and let it stand fifteen minutes
or over night. The two bricks are ready for use any
minute and stay so indefinitely. The smallest is big
enough for kindling. Maker’s circular sent.</p>

<p>Ignites with a match. You put it out by dipping it
in water. Throwing water on it does not put it out.</p>

styles too pronounced if not “carried over

especially hard to get satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Dyeing at home in the most satisfactory manner is
very easy and profitable. Silk and woolen stuffs come
out of the dye about as nice as when they were new.
For cotton some of the colors have to be specially made.
Wood stains are made from the dyes.</p>

<p>Diamond dyes are complete in themselves; that is,
nothing more is required to set the colors. It is really
no more difficult to dye with most of the colors than to
rinse or starch. And full instructions accompany the
dyes.</p>

<p>The colors are: yellow, old-gold, orange; green,
olive-green, dark-green; pink, magenta, scarlet, crimson,
cardinal, garnet, terra-cotta, maroon, dark-wine;
violet, plum, purple; light-blue, navy-blue, dark-blue;
slate, drab, black; and yellow for cotton, green for
cotton, cardinal for cotton, scarlet for cotton, and blue

<p>Diamond dyes do not stain the hands or utensils if
used with a little care. You handle the stuffs with
sticks till you come to the wringing.</p>

<p>Prang’s Water-color Studies are the best examples of
what is known as the new style of water-color painting,
in which transparent colors only are mixed in the
brush and laid on broadly.</p>

<p>They are reproductions of works by American artists
designed primarily for instruction in art, but none the
less available for home-decoration on that account.
Indeed they rank the higher in interest, being all they
seem to common eyes, and faithful illustrations besides
of recent advances in one of the least familiar
departments of Art. They are not unfinished sketches,
but exquisite finished color-work. The use we expect
to introduce them to by this List is chiefly the non-professional,
home-decoration. Let it be understood,
there is nothing more fit for that use, and nothing
higher, within the reach of people of limited means.</p>

<p>They comprise landscapes, marine views, flowers,
animals, birds and figure pieces from such artists as
Turner, Moran, Bridges, Lambdin, Giacomelli, etc.</p>

<p>We send Prang’s catalogue and supply whatever may
be selected from it at the rate of $1.10 in new subscriptions

<p>Seth Thomas Watch in argentine case for $10 in new
subscriptions; in silver case for $15 in new subscriptions.
Postage 10 cents.</p>

<p>There is strong competition between the American
watch-manufactories on low-price watches. The struggle
is to make the best for the money. That is the way
to capture the market. Seth Thomas watch is ahead.</p>

<p>We buy the movement separate. There is no established
price for the watch as we send it out. We are
giving the most we can get for the money. The watch
is a good time-keeper; durable; open-face; has
seven jewels; is decidedly worth repairing; good
enough; a great deal better than any foreign watch
for the money; better than any other American watch
for the money.</p>

<p>The argentine case is a substitute for silver, substantial,
keeps its silver look. The silver case is no better,
unless you object to an imitation. The argentine
case is plain, the silver is chased (“turned” is the
technical word), the neatest of watch-case engraving.
Stem-winders and setters of course.</p>

</div>

<p>A sort of
sewing-machine attachment; not strictly
that; for it is not attached; may be used
with any machine, or without a machine, the sewing
done by hand.</p>

<p>With it a woman of taste and aptness with colors can
get out of her rag-bag beautiful rugs with almost no
expense beyond sewing-cotton and dyes [see <a href="#Diamond_Dyes">Diamond
Dyes</a>, page 23 of this list.]</p>

<p>The rug-maker is simply a nickeled steel-wire frame
on which to wind cut rags or yarns preparatory to sewing
them on a substantial
foundation. Not hard
to learn the use of. Not
hard to use. A sort of
homely art-work with
waste materials, splendidly
profitable.</p>

<p>The finished rug is a velvet, the pile of which is made
by cutting the loops as they come from the rug-maker.
The product of one day’s work may be as pretty and
rich a rug as you would buy for several dollars. All
depends on your taste, materials, colors, industry,
patience. There is something of the constructive artist
in every woman of taste.</p>

<h2>CHAUTAUQUA YOUNG FOLKS’ READING UNION.</h2>


<p>1. There are few forces more powerful in the shaping of
character than those which spring from reading. <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i> has sent thousands of boys to sea, and other books
less wholesome have sent thousands to prison; many a
youth has been inspired to noble aims and a useful life by
the help of a good book. A distinguished scientist says
that a single book which fell into his hands during boyhood
gave him “a twist toward science.”</p>

<p>2. It is not a question whether our young people will read
or not, for nearly all of them do read. The question is
whether they shall read a helpful or a harmful literature, for
every book and paper belongs to either one class or the
other. There is but one way to keep out the harmful, and
that is to supply the helpful. At a public conference on the
subject of literature for young people one speaker said, “I
find that when I keep the table in my own house well covered
with good papers for young people my children have no
desire for a low class of story-papers.” A shelf of good,
interesting books for young people will save them from depraved
taste in reading.</p>

<p>3. One difficulty in the way of supplying the home with
good literature is that parents are too busy. To provide a
pure and healthful course of reading, and with it the impulse
to follow it, the <span class="smcap">Chautauqua Young Folks’ Reading
Union</span> has been established. This is an outgrowth of the
Chautauqua movement, which aims to promote popular education
for every grade and every age, and is the peculiar
adaptation of the Chautauqua Course to young people. It
takes in the main the same subjects as those of the Chautauqua
Literary and Scientific Circle, and fits them to the needs
of the young, so that while the older people are pursuing
one course of reading, the boys and girls, from twelve years,
and upward, may read in the same lines and on the same
themes. The course includes history, science, literature,
travel, household matters, “ways to do things,” etc., mainly
in short articles, which can be easily read. It can be accomplished
in less than two hours of each week, for as many
years as the student chooses to follow it, for each year’s
reading is complete in itself.</p>

<p>4. The Readings of the <span class="smcap">Chautauqua Young Folks’
Reading Union</span> are of two kinds, Serial and in Books.
The Serial Readings are contained in a monthly supplement
to <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span>, a magazine for young people which stands
at the head of its class in literature. This supplement is
also published as a separate periodical, called the <span class="smcap">Chautauqua
Young Folks’ Journal</span>. The Book Readings consist
generally of three standard books adapted for young people.
With the course are furnished to enrolled members the
“Outline Memoranda,” or questions for examination, not
a severe test of knowledge of the Readings, but suggestive,
and calling forth the thoughts and opinions of the reader.</p>

<p>5. The Course may be taken by individuals, each reading
by himself, or by a number reading together and meeting
in a Local Club or Circle. Such a Club may be organized
by the teacher of a school among the scholars, and will furnish
pleasant and elevating enjoyment, as well as training in
composition, debating, observation, etc., by its exercises.
The members may read papers of their own writing upon
the subjects of the course, may present questions, may look
at pictures of objects and places referred to, and may witness
simple experiments in science, and may also have social
recreation at its meetings. [For plans of organization and
management of a Local Club, send for the handbook.]</p>

<p>6. All that is requisite for membership is to send name
and address, with ten cents in postage stamps, to the Secretary,
Miss Kate F. Kimball, Plainfield, N. J. <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span>
contains much besides the readings—serial stories, short
stories, illustrated articles, and poems—while the <span class="smcap">Chautauqua
Young Folks’ Journal</span> contains but little besides the
readings. Besides one of the magazines, the three books
cost $1.70. [For the Course of the coming year see next
page.]</p>

<p>7. Every enrolled member receives free of cost a Certificate
of Membership. It is an albertype, with a symbolic
picture embodying the light-bearing spirit of the Union,
and is suited to framing for the home. For each year’s
reading a seal is given, which is to be affixed to the certificate.
Thus the engraving will show by its seals the years
of the member’s reading.</p>

<h3>ANNOUNCEMENT.</h3>

<p><i>The next Course of Readings will begin in the December
number of</i> <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="smcap">Journal</span> <i>and run through
1888. Something of the value and interest may be gathered
from the following prospectus.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h3>SEVENTH ANNUAL COURSE.</h3>

<h4>REQUIRED READINGS (SERIAL).</h4>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Dear Old Story-Tellers.</span> By <i>Oscar Fay Adams</i>.
A set of most delightful papers about certain old authors
and certain old stories whose names and titles are constantly
occurring in general literature. Whatever of importance
and interest is known about these authors Mr. Adams has
here gathered up; and a good idea is given of the work
which has made them famous, valued and remembered.
These “Readings” will be very helpful for all who wish to
understand the allusions in literature to standard old stories
and romances. Many portraits and illustrations.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">U. S. Military and Naval Schools.</span> By <i>Louis
T. Peale</i>. A good series for family reading, as both
boys and girls are growing more and more interested in the
way our Government conducts affairs, and these papers explain
just what means are taken to train up a noble body of
men to protect our country and maintain her interests and
her rights by land and sea. While the series is of general
interest to everybody, it will be especially hailed by boys
who have dreams of entering the army or the navy; they
will find here a complete manual of answers to all the
questions they or their anxious friends can possibly ask as to
what the boys must do for the Government, and what the
Government does for the boys. Illustrations.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Our Asiatic Cousins.</span> By <i>Mrs. A. H. Leonowens</i>.
Mrs. Leonowens lived a long time in the far East, an inmate
of both palace and tent, and had opportunities of knowing
face to face both royal potentates and the common people.
She has written these articles especially for the members of
the C. Y. F. R. U., and they are very interesting. Fully
illustrated.</p>

<p>IV. “<span class="smcap">Diamond Dust.</span>” By <i>Mrs. S. D. Power</i>. Some
chatty articles about precious stones, our native gems, and
beautiful objects in the mineral world.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">Ways to do Things.</span> All sorts. The first will be the
“Way” to take care of dogs, by <i>Louise Imogen Guiney</i>.</p>

<p>VI. <span class="smcap">Search-Questions in Roman History.</span> By <i>Oscar
Fay Adams</i>. Twenty questions each month. Book prizes
for correct lists of answers. Particulars in both <span class="smcap">Wide
Awake</span> and the <span class="smcap">Journal</span>.</p>

<h4>REQUIRED READINGS (BOOKS).</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A Family Flight Around Home.</span> Part I. By
Edward Everett Hale and Susan Hale. A new volume of
this delightful series, describing the scenes and events of
early New England history, etc. Illustrations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Poets’ Homes.</span> By Arthur Gilman, and others. Charming
pen and pencil pictures of the homes and haunts of the
poets—and the poets themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nelly Marlow in Washington.</span> By Laura D. Nichols.
Those who went with Nelly Marlow “Up Hill and
Down Dale” will surely wish to go with her to Washington.
Illustrations.</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>“The files we have had bound are so popular as
to be in danger of being literally read to pieces;
and, knowing well that the new ones will meet the
same treatment, we earnestly hope that the time
will never come when it will be impossible to replace
them; for they are a source of too much enjoyment
and benefit to our young people to be
allowed to get out of print—that would be a great
misfortune.”<i>—Extract from letter of the Librarian of the Morse Institute,
Natick, Mass., ordering the first nineteen volumes of</i>
<span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span>.</p>

<p>One in a dozen families—no, not so many—one
in a hundred eats good food. About as many
read good books. And yet the proportion of good
eating and reading is quite as high in this as in any
country. The fact is some good food is a little dry.
Good reading is never peppery. We are losing
our capacity for enjoyment of both when we crave
unwholesome stimulants.</p>

<p><i>Wide Awake</i> is one of those rare collections
varied and bright enough to engage the common
reader and good enough to lead the capable reader
to higher pleasures and benefits.</p>

<p>Volume W contains: a yachting story, by Charles
R. Talbot; Peggy and her Family, by Margaret
Sidney; Pamela’s Fortune, by Lucy C. Lillie;
Pocahontas and Rolfe, by Mrs. Blathwayt; Turkish
Childhood, by Hon. S. S. Cox; Some Nantucket
Children, by Mrs. Macy; stories of early American
warfare; no end of short stories and sketches,
poems, engravings, etc.</p>

<p>Volume X is equally full and fine. The two
volumes make the year. The covers are bright

<p>By F. S. W. Illustrated by nine full-page

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>The writer, his children having an interest in
heraldry, set himself at the task of telling them
what he knew of it. Hence the book; which
treats the whole subject formally, yet with a pleasant
vacation air.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Book journeys through the several countries
with eyes and ears wide open, old eyes and young
eyes and ears. The books are full of pictures, and
fuller of knowledge not only of what is going on
but what has gone on ever since book-making began,
and fuller yet of brightness and interest. You see
the old as old; but you see it; you see where it was
and the marks it left. You see the new with eyes
made sharper by knowledge of what has gone in
the world.</p>

<p>In other words these books amount to something
like going through these places with a traveling
companion who knows all about them and their
histories.</p>

<p>They are written and pictured for boys and girls;

<p class="unindent"><b>Bubbling Teapot.</b></p>

<p>A Wonder Story by <span class="smcap">Lizzie W. Champney</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>A discontented little girl is the Bubbling Teapot
of a sort of Japanese Arabian Night. She tries a
great many kinds of life and concludes that the
nicest life, after all, is that of a little American girl.
It is a dream-story.</p></div>


<p class="unindent"><b>In No-Man’s Land.</b></p>

<p>A Wonder Story by <span class="smcap">E. S. Brooks</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>A Dream-story as droll as Alice in Wonderland.
Not like Alice; and yet can there be two sorts of
dream-nonsense so witty and wild, so mixed up
and yet not muddy a whit? The plays on nursery
rhymes are enough to make the fortune of almost a
dull book. And “there isn’t a dull line in it.”</p></div>

<h4><i>Bound Volumes of Two Illustrated Magazines.</i></h4>


<p class="hang1"><b>Our Little Men and Women for 1887.</b></p>

<p>4to, 74 full-page illustrations, cloth, 2.00;
boards, 1.50.</p>
<div class="blockquot3">
<p>Nearly 300 pages of pictures and stories,
sketches, lessons, and entertainments easy
to read and understand, for children six to
eight years old. As bright as a book can
be, and as full of help towards wholesome
progress in learning, growth of mind and
the formation of good habits and taste in
reading.</p>

<p>The cover is daintily beautiful.</p>
</div>

<p class="hang1"><b>The Pansy for 1887.</b></p>

<p>4to, cloth, 1.75; boards, 1.25.</p>
<div class="blockquot3">
<p>More than 400 pages of reading and
pictures for children of eight to fifteen
years in various lines of interest. There
are sketches of home and foreign life, religious
instruction, biography, history, fiction,
anecdote, letter-writing. The editor
is the author of the Pansy books, which
means that the drift of <i>The Pansy</i> is all one
way.</p>

<p>The cover is almost made of pansies,
purple and gold, with a pair of happy children
on a grassy bank, and a flock of
butterflies.</p></div>


<p class="hang1"><b>Real Fairy Folks.</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Lucy Rider Meyer</span>, A.M. Illustrated,
12mo, cloth, $1.50.</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>A play-excursion into chemistry, none the less
serious because it is play, and none the less play
because it is serious.</p>

<p>We quote from the author’s word to parents:
“This book is true to chemical fact and principle.
It is an effort to make them love the beautiful
science of chemistry and to lift their thoughts to the
One who holds in His hand the atoms as securely
as He holds the worlds.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless it is a book of diversion, a story-book,
a fairy story-book. A queer combination,
but we believe successful. We much mistake if it
is not splendidly successful.</p></div>


<p class="hang1"><b>Story Book of Science.</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Lydia Hoyt Farmer</span>. Illustrated,
12mo, cloth, $1.50.</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>This also is fact and fiction in science; stories
made upon what goes on in the world, the scientific
and practical world. Glass-making is in it; and
silk; a great many insects; snow; wind; the seven
modern wonders; birds; animals; tea, coffee, pepper,
potatoes; what not? There are subjects
enough, and learning enough; and there is fun in
finding out how the world is put together.</p></div>


<p class="hang1"><b>Look-About Club.</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Mary E. Bamford</span>. 4to, cloth, 1.50.</p>
<div class="blockquot3">
<p>The Club is a family given to study of
animals. Under the guise of play the
family learns about spiders and butterflies,
chickens and rabbits, fishes and
frogs, the folks in the brook, the folks on
the ground and the folks in the air, which
includes grasshoppers and beetles.</p>

<p>There is a great deal to know about our
neighbors, worth knowing, too; and the
surest way to begin learning is to like it.
That is why such books as this are made,
to make young people like the beginnings
of learning.</p></div>


<p class="hang1"><b>Little Polly Blatchley.</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Frances C. Sparhawk</span>. 4to, boards,
1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Delightful stories out of little Polly’s life. Polly
is what elderly people call an “old” little girl.
She is continually thinking of things that little
people are apt to skip; and she keeps her thoughts
to herself so wisely and lets them out so in the nick
of time, she delights her good papa and mamma
in the book and the little girl who reads it. It is a
rare book for pleasure and wholesome suggestion.</p></div>


<p class="hang1"><b>Playfellows and Their Pets.</b></p>

<p>4to, boards, 1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Short stories about children, animals and birds,
with a great many pictures. Not a page but is full
of entertainment, instruction and means of growth
for pretty good readers of six or eight or ten—Do
little folks go by ages nowadays?</p></div>


<p class="hang1"><b>After Play Stories for the Little Ones.</b></p>

<p>4to, boards, 1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Beginning stories for little readers, or to be read
to people too little to read for themselves.</p>

<p>There is one about the Puzzled Baby, which begins
in this way:</p>

<p>“I am a baby. But I don’t want you to think
I am one of these little bits of things who know
nothing at all. I am an <i>old</i> baby. I am almost
ten months old!</p>

<p>“I have a cousin who is only nine weeks old.
The little goose don’t know how to get his toes in
his mouth!”</p></div>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>A chatty going over the events of day after day
of a journey through northern and southern Europe
into Asia, the Holy Land especially. Dr. McKenzie’s
name is enough in New England. Outside
also.</p></div>

<p class="hang1"><b>American Authors for Young Folks.</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Amanda B. Harris</span>. 12mo, cloth,
$1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Not exhaustive essays upon but rather clues to
our writers who need not be named for their eminence
and whom not to know is not to know the
American part in English letters.</p></div>


<p class="hang1"><b>Dorothy Thorn of Thornton.</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Julian Warth</span>. 12 mo., $1.25.</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>The chemist’s dainty daughter draws the old
dreamer out of his laboratory and the young dreamer
out of his yacht, the one as neatly as the other.</p>

<p>There is a factory in the story, with a hard-headed
business man for a manager and a gentleman
for owner. There is a community of working
men; their lives and feelings and interests, also
their schemes and plans. A minister; two of them,
one a woman; one to society, one to the working
people. A strike, a mob, a murder, a settlement.</p>

<p>The manufacturer wins, and so do the workmen.
So does the chemist’s daughter, as indeed she
deserves.</p></div>


<p class="hang1"><b>Gladys.</b></p>

<p>A Romance. By <span class="smcap">Mary G. Darling</span>.
12mo, $1.25.</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>A story of love—the ever-new old story. The
bright and beautiful daughter of a fond old man
who has nothing to do but delight in her pleasure,
and watch her numerous lovers, spends her first
summer after school-days at Bar Harbor. Too
good and true to be spoiled by pursuit, she, nevertheless,
but slowly learns to distinguish conjugal
love. Her fortune takes her more or less blindly
through the school of experience—a school that
tempers not its exactions.</p>

<p>There are interesting stories within the larger
story, and interesting fragments of other lives than
the two. We part from several of the personages
unwillingly.</p></div>


<p class="hang1"><b>After School Days.</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Christina Goodwin</span>. 12mo, cloth,
1.00.</p>
<div class="blockquot3">
<p>A tale: quite a new sort of history.
School-days over, four girl friends return
to their homes and life begins. As often
happens, life is not as they picture it.
What it is for the four and how they severally
meet it—that is the story.</p></div>


<p class="hang1"><b>For a Girl’s Room.</b></p>

<p>12mo, cloth, 1.00.</p>
<div class="blockquot3">
<p>A practical help for a girl to surround
herself with pleasant things with little expense.
The book is mainly filled with
ways to exercise taste on waste or picked-up
things for use with an eye to decoration
as well. A friendly sort of a book to fill
odd minutes whether at home or out, for
herself or another. By no means on “fancy
work”—not all work—Chapter <span class="smcap">XXI</span> is how
to tame birds, and <span class="smcap">XXV</span> is what to do in
emergencies.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Royal Girls.</span> By M. E. W. Sherwood. Ill.
Boston: D. Lothrop Company. Price $1.25. One
thing readers will learn from this volume by Mrs.
Sherwood, and that is that girls who happen to
be born princesses are very much like those who
are born in ordinary households, and that human
nature is pretty much the same in a palace as it is in
an American farmhouse. But they will learn, too,
that in most royal families the daughters are subjected
to a course of discipline and training more
severe and exacting than ever fell to the lot of
an American girl. They are obliged to study early
and late; they must have not only a thorough
knowledge of the languages, of music and of
court etiquette, but also of the politics of their
own and other governments; they must know
something of statecraft and of diplomacy, for
no princess knows what station she may be some
time called on to fill. No American girl need
envy them, says Mrs. Sherwood. “They are in
chains, all of them. They must be careful what
they say, do, think even. With royal girls, what
interrupted destinies, what cruel disappointments,
what unhappy marriages, what a contrast between
the desire and fulfilment do we constantly see.”
There are certain things in which Mrs. Sherwood
thinks they might serve as models to American
girls, with whom she frequently compares them.
The volume contains sketches of the royal girls
of Italy, of Spain, of Denmark, of Russia, of
England and of Germany, and two chapters are
devoted to “Carmen Sylva,” the queen of Roumania
and the empress of Austria. The author
describes very entertainingly the home life of
some of these girls, and the rules of etiquette to
which they are obliged to conform. The volume
is well illustrated with portraits.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">What People Live By.</span> By Count Leo Tolstoi.
Translated by Mrs. Aline Delano. Boston: D.
Lothrop Company. Price $1.00. A remarkable little
story by the distinguished Russian writer, Count
Tolstoi, has been translated by Mrs. Aline Delano,
and cannot fail to impress the reader more
strongly than ever with the wonderful power of
the author in dealing with religious or psychological
subjects. It was written for a distinct purpose;
to show, in the words of the title, “What
People Live By.” Nothing can be more severely
simple than the story, which is thus summed up.
“I have learned,” says Tolstoi, “that man lives
not by care for himself, but by love.... I
know that God has given life to men, and wishes
them to live. Now I know another truth: the
truth that God does not wish man to live apart;
therefore He has not revealed to them what each
needs for himself. He wishes them to live together,
and therefore reveals to each the others’
wants.” The translation seems to be very close
to the original.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
